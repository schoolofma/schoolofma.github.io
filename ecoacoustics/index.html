      <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>



    <p class="text">Ecoacoustics is an intensive four-week program led by artists Florence To and Antoine Bertin.</p> 

      <p class="text">Combining elements of spatial recording, virtual reality sound design, and audio installation practices, participants are invited to develop an immersive experience using the unique 4DSOUND system, of which there exist only two in the world.</p> 
    

    <p class="text">Leading an exploration of materials, form, human body, binaural recordings, interactive audio, and listening practices, participants are taken on a journey to reveal new and unexpected sensations.</p>



      <p class="text">Our listening reality is intimate, tactile, spatial, social and temporal. Using creative, analogue and digital means of bending the sense of hearing, students are invited to explore the idea of a sound-driven virtual reality. Listening through the ear and vibrations through the body, the group will devise original strategies of blurring the boundary between the virtual and the real.</p>

      <p class="text">We will survey different techniques and their applications to gain insight on the future directions of sound. How can these techniques help us in creating stories that cross the boundaries of traditional design? As we investigate spatial sculpture and architectural environments, we will gain further understanding of psychoacoustics and creative learning through physical objects. </p>


      <p class="text">This workshop will take you from the intricacies of the ear to the surface of the skin, learning within resonant spaces, and journeying through the new possibilities in sound experience design that have emerged through the boom of virtual reality. Learning to design sound composition through storytelling not only through digital but within intuitive crafts to create an individual learning and listening process throughout the program. </p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Noqturnl</strong> is an overnight performance exploring the threshold between waking and dreaming. NOQTURNL art director Florence To and composer John Connell share a deep interest in the way technology and media can alter perception ­ affecting the formation of our personal and social constructs, both positively and adversely. They have been collaborating with spatial sound collective 4DSOUND since 2014 to explore how spatial audio­visual technologies can encourage constructive environments for self­-reflection, creative ideation and social interaction.</p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >In the Eyes of the Animal</strong> For this project Antoine Bertin in collaboration with Marshmallow Laser Feast created a virtual reality experience with binaural sound design. It enables users to encounter a forrest in a brand new way.  A 360º film, it is an artistic interpretation of the sensory perspectives of three species natural to the site.</p>

            <p class="text">Art Director and Installation Artist Florence To merged her skills into digital technologies in 2011, designing and performing sound and light installations after completing a Masters in Design at The Glasgow School of Art in 2007, specializing and working in tailoring and textiles for 8 years. To originally developed her installation work in underground and disused spaces using its defects as an advantage. Through working in various disparate architectural environments guided her research further into cognitive and emotional triggers; exploring the effects of experience within space, the physical presence within vibrations, and how different sensory arrangements can create an emotional and psychological impact.</p>

            <p class="text">The Scottish-born artist has been invited for artistic residencies at the Société des Arts Technologiques [SAT] in Montreal, 4DSOUND Spatial Sound Institute in Budapest, and The Spatialization and Auditory Display Environment [SpADE] in Limerick. To has exhibited, performed and given workshops at LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial in Gijon, Southbank Centre in London and most recent installation ‘EOAN’ was supported by the European Network for Contemporary Audiovisual Creation [ENCAC]. She is currently part of a creative fellowship with the DCN (Department of Clinical Neuroscience) in Edinburgh. </p>
