# Responsive Spaces Week One

Amazing first week at School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe Responsive Spaces program! What made it so amazing? All the lovely people, of course! People with a strong desire to learn, as well as instructors, guests and friends with a strong desire to teach and to share.

This week wouldn't have been the same without: 
<li>

<ul>Anrick Bregman (genuine human and believer in the power of story),</ul> 
<ul>S. Astrid Bin (gutsy interaction designer extraordinaire), </ul>
<ul>Irina Spicaka and Krisjanis Rijnieks (our favourite projection mapping power duo), </ul>
<ul>So Kanno and Takahiro Yamaguchi (our other favourite power duo, this one focused on drawing robots!), </ul>
<ul>Victor Diaz (he came up with camelwifi--what's not to love!), </ul>
<ul>Abe Pazos (one of our main instructors, and reorderer of bananas!), </ul>
<ul>Farah / NK (our lovely hosts for the last OTS Creative Code Stammtisch)</ul>
<ul>and of course our oh so lovely students from around the world!</ul>

</li>
