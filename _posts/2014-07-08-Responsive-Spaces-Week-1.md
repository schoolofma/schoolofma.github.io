# Responsive Spaces: Week One in Pictures!

Amazing first week at School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe Responsive Spaces program! What made it so amazing? Well, people of course! People with a strong desire to learn, as well as instructors, guests and friends with a strong desire to teach and to share.

This week wouldn't have been the same without Anrick Bregman, S. Astrid Bin, Irina Spicaka, Krisjanis Rijnieks, So Kanno, Takahiro Yamaguchi, Victor Diaz, Abe Pazos, Arturo Castro, Farah / NK and our oh so lovely students from around the world!
