# Responsive Spaces: Week One in Pictures!


 <p>Amazing first week at School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe Responsive Spaces program! What made it so amazing, well, people of course! People with a strong desire to learn, as well as instructors, guests and friends with a strong desire to teach and to share.</p>  
 
 <p>This week wouldn't have been the same without Anrick Bregman, S. Astrid Bin, Irina Spicaka, Krisjanis Rijnieks, So Kanno, Takahiro Yamaguchi, Victor Diaz, Abe Pazos, Arturo Castro, Farah / NK and our oh so lovely students from around the world! </p>
