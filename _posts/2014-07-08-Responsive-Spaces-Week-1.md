# Responsive Spaces: The Beginning!

Amazing first week at School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe Responsive Spaces program! What made it so amazing? All the lovely people, of course! People with a strong desire to learn, as well as instructors, guests and friends with a strong desire to teach and to share. This week wouldn't have been the same without: 

<div>
<ul><b>Anrick Bregman</b> (genuine human and believer in the power of story),</ul> 
<ul><b>S. Astrid Bin</b> (gutsy interaction designer extraordinaire), </ul>
<ul><b>Irina Spicaka / Krisjanis Rijnieks</b> (our favourite projection mapping power duo), </ul>
<ul><b>So Kanno / Takahiro Yamaguchi</b> (our other favourite power duo, focused on drawing robots!), </ul>
<ul><b>Victor Diaz</b> (he came up with camelwifi--what's not to love!), </ul>
<ul><b>Abe Pazos</b> (one of our main instructors, and reorderer of bananas!), </ul>
<ul><b>Farah / NK</b> (our lovely hosts for the last OTS Creative Code Stammtisch)</ul>
<ul>and of course our oh so lovely students from around the world: Brent, Diogo, Esteban, James, Soma, Julia, Kurt, Luca, Milos, Orlagh, Pere, and Vaishali!</ul>
