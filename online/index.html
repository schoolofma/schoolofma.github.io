<h5 class="title">How It Works</h5>
       <p class="text">Welcome to our online courses! Soon we will create an FAQ for these programs. For now, it's important to note that these online classes will be taking place over the course of four weeks, for two hours each week. Plan in an extra hour for homework and you'll be set!</p>

       <p class="text">Classes are live meaning that you can directly interact with the instructor as well as with the other participants from around the world. Classes will also be recorded for playback in case you are unable to attend for any reason. More info coming soon! For specific questions, please email info[at]schoolofma.org</p>

      <p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >How many times a day  do we accept, without negotiating, the everyday demands inscribed in the  design of user interfaces? What rhetoric hides the apparent neutrality  of its design? How does the data we generate  through an interface transform and encode our social and intimate  sphere?  </strong></p>
      <p class="text">This program seeks to critically reveal, analyze, and connect the complex  network of agents that converge on the configuration of the Graphic User  Interface (GUI). During this four week course we will creatively reveal,  deconstruct, and re-articulate the material and immaterial elements that  make up the GUI in order to reflect on its role and influence within  the social, political, economic, cultural and emotional spheres of the  networked society. </p>

Is it enough to just ’spark a debate’ and hope other people will do the rest? </strong></p>

          <p class="text">The ambition of the course is to help participants understand the mechanisms of activist art and provide an overview of the most inspiring and thought-provoking actions of politically-minded creative practioners. The sessions will also be designed to leave space for debates and reflection over contentious and ambiguous questions relevant to contemporary society.</p>
