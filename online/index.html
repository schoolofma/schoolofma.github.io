       <p class="text">We will soon begin a series of online courses aimed at engaging critical discourse, and creative approaches to social practice in the realm of art, technology, and design. Because the world is in chaos. Because we feel confused. Because our instinct is take action in the form of helping to spread important messages far and wide. </p>

       <h4 class="title">A Mapping of Socially-Engaged Creative Practices</h4></br>

      <p class="text">Our first live course will be led by, Regine Debatty, creator of <a href="http://we-make-money-not-art.com/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">we-make-money-not-art.com</a>. RÃ©gine is known for her writings at the intersection between art, science, technology, and social issues. She writes and lectures internationally about the way artists, hackers and designers use technology as a medium for critical discussion. </p>

      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4></br>
      <p class="text">Encompassing themes such as the anthropocene, the rise of artificial intelligence, lab-grown life and the enduring traces of colonialism, this course will be looking at the tools and strategies developed by creative minds to address and sometimes successfully hijack some of today's most worrisome issues. 

      <p class="text">More information on this and other courses will follow.<br> Sign-ups begin soon. Stay tuned!</p>
