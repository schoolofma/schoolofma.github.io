            <p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >How can artists, activists, designers and other creative minds take a stand and be heard in these days and age of ecological crisis, unfettered intolerance, and growing economic inequalities?

Is it enough to just ’spark a debate’ and hope other people will do the rest? </strong> </p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>
</br>

<p class="text">The ambition of the course is to help participants understand the mechanisms of activist art and provide an overview of the most inspiring and thought-provoking actions of politically-minded creative practioners. The sessions will also be designed to leave space for debates and reflection over contentious and ambiguous questions relevant to contemporary society.

<p class="text">Each week, the first half of the course will look at a particular political, cultural, technological or ethical theme that is the source of growing concern in society. Namely: the anthropocene, the persistence of colonialism, the rise of intelligent machines, the new forms of life engineered in laboratories. </p>

<p class="text">Each theme will be illustrated by artworks and public actions that have engaged successfully (and also not successfully because we can always learn from our mistakes) with the topic examined. These case studies will be mostly contemporary, with several incursions into historical precedents: anti-slavery activism in the 19th century, social upheaval in Ancient Greece, liberation struggles in the 60s and 70s, etc.</p>

<p class="text">The other half of the course will explore strategies, tools, and ideas to keep in mind no matter what the topic of the week will be. </p>


<p class="text">Each week, an assignment will invite participants to reflect on an ambiguous issue and to articulate an opinion based on their position or inability to take a clear position.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this course for?
</h4>

<p class="text">Politically-minded artists, designers and makers who believe that their ideas, concerns and beliefs should be heard outside of the usual white walls of cultural institutions. Activists looking for inventive strategies to get their message across. And pretty much anyone worried about the state of the world.

 <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4></br>

    <p class="text">Most of our life transactions are mediated by interfaces. Nevertheless, far from being neutral entities, interfaces exercise a great deal of power over its users, representing one of the major anti-democratic governance entities in our society. In this program we will look into the ways interfaces are affecting us as a global society and will collectively think on ways to democratize them. Interfaces for the people! </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/interface.jpg" class="pic">
    

<p class="text">This program seeks to critically reveal, analyze and connect the complex  network of agents that converge on the configuration of the Graphic User  Interface (GUI). During this four week course we will creatively reveal,  deconstruct, and re-articulate the material and immaterial elements that  construct the GUI in order to reflect on its role and influence within  the social, political, economic, cultural and emotional spheres of the  networked society. </p>

<p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to  provide students with the theoretical background on Interface design along with technical skills, such as basic HTML and CSS, to explore, develop and  test disruptive methodologies to incorporate democratic values within  Interfaces, an urgent exercise to generate critical thought about the  true nature of technology, and in the imagination of alternative  techno-paradigms which may coherently respond to our environmental and  human conditions.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this course for?
</h4>

<p class="text">
This program is for artists, designers, writers, makers, coders, journalists and researchers interested in understanding, exploring and disrupting networks and interfaces. We will also investigate the underlying intentions of user interfaces, and how the UI designs demonstrate the latent political, socioeconomic, emotional, and cultural opinions of their designers.</p>

<p class="text">During the program we will reveal
the underlying narratives embedded in everyday interfaces,
such as Facebook and Google, in order to reveal to what extent they
sculpt and govern our realities in a silent way.</p>

<h4 class="title">Course Outline</h4>

<p class="text"><h5>Week 1</h5> 
<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Beyond the Interface I: Internet infrastructures, Data flows & Geopolitics.  </strong> During this week we will reveal the main infrastructures and actors (companies and agencies) that configure the Internet and will explore how the data is traveling across the world.</p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">
Keywords:</strong>  internet backbone, data forensics, net neutrality, internet geopolitics.
</p>

<h5>Week 2</h5>
<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Beyond the Interface II: Online surveillance and commodification of Data.  </strong> In this session we will show how the data that we generate through interfaces is being tracked, harvested and commodified. We will look into the methodologies and tools used by many corporations and agencies that silently access and use the information we produce in daily basis. </p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">
Keywords:</strong> online tracking, data brokers, profiling.
</p>

<h5>Week 3</h5>
<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Interface materiality: The environmental impact of code. </strong> During this session we will learn how code is constructing web interfaces. We will look closely to HTML and CSS and explain how this languages work. At the same time, we will look into the environmental impact of interfaces in order to understand how its footprint could be dramatically reduced through code.</p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">
Keywords:</strong> code & ideology, HTML, CSS, data & CO2, sustainability.
</p>

<h5>Week 4</h5>
<p class="text">In the last week of the program we will discuss how graphic interface design is homogenizing behavior in a global a scale and the several consequences of this process. On the other hand we will experiment with simple disruptive methodologies to intervene the interface design of the most used websites globally in order to subvert such cultural homogenization.</p>
<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">
Keywords: </strong>interface governance, corporative design, community design, CSS, HTML.
