    <p class="text">Winners and Losers is an intensive four-week program led by creative artists and educators Alice Stewart, Mike Lazer-Walker, and returning favourites Kati Hyppä and Niklas Roy.


    <p class="text">Children grow up with a playful instinct. We learn to relate to, interact with and understand other humans through ‘games’. These games teach us notions of competition and cooperation that help acclimatize us to the adult world. Wrapped up in the idea of a game is frequently a notion of winning or losing. How does this conception trickle into our adult psyches and affect the social, economic and physical infrastructure we co-create?</p>

    <p class="text">Through world-building, and the creation of interactive and tactile experiences, we will create experimental games in the form of physical artifacts and installations. To do this, we will use both hardware and software to sense and respond to the environment around us as we set out to envision new societies and new modalities of play that might exist within them.</p>

<p class="text">In this four-week intensive program guided by artists and speculative designers Sascha Pohflepp and Chris Woebken, you will be designing experiences through use of live-action role play techniques (LARPing), computer vision, machine learning, and speculative prototyping.</p>

<p class="text">We will provide a framework that revolves around a rapidly changing world increasingly bound to be populated by non-humans, both natural and artificial—such as advanced AI systems. Making their perspectives  experienceable is going to be a key angle to designing for the new societies that will emerge.</p>


<p class="text">What you will learn: An overview of future studies tools, crafting scenarios, collaborative work, narrative prototyping, simulation techniques, character and game design for live action roleplaying, basics of advanced machine learning/neural networks, digital fabrication, environment/set design, project critique, exhibition production and documentation. </p>

      <p class="text">The primary tool of this program will be Unity 3D. We will also incorporate 3D, 360 video, video-tracking, and micro-controllers. As we engage the potential of these new tools, we will also take a critical perspective discussing the shortcomings and challenges of future technologies. No previous experience in virtual reality required.

 <p class="text">This program offers a hands-on course in storymaking and storytelling.  Working as an experimental film unit,​ over the course of four weeks, w​e will speculate around the cultural and social impacts that the advances in virtual reality may have on society, forming narratives centred around personal visions of virtual worlds.</p>

<p class="text">We will build a collection of experimental 360° films, each presenting different immersive experiences and stories within imagined virtual realities.</p>

<p class="text">The films will be informed by our investigation into virtual reality itself as an emerging and complicated technology. Narratives will form around characters and situations which probe at what it means for virtual reality to become mainstream for future entertainment, education and other forms of escape.</p>

<p class="text">By developing these films, our objective will be to​ uncover and experiment with techniques for making new narrative experiences. U​tilising dedicated film camera equipment and editing software, combined with the physical prototyping of props, we will test out new forms for fiction and transport our imagination into the make­-believe. </p>

  Computer vision is a responsive, interactive, and exciting tool for realising creative vision.
  From tracking body movements to face detection and pixel manipulation, computer vision is a rich area that opens up many new possibilities. Low cost cameras and open source platforms now make this field much more accessible allowing us to introduce powerful algorithmic approaches to our creative endeavors. </p>

  <p class="text">These kinds of technologies are also pervasive in our daily lives and understanding their inner workings will allow us to challenge and play with them in creative and subversive ways.</p>

          <p>The relationship between data (information) and stories is rich and multi-layered. Now more than ever, questioning the origins of our data and how it is collected is essential to our understanding of it.  With an eye on perception, objectivity, critical thinking, analysis, misinformation and truth, we’ll examine data, and in turn data visualisation, in all its grotesque and beautiful facets, focusing on the finer details of how to pull a story from data and craft it into something meaningful.</p>

		<p> Classes were a mix of lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, technologists and educators, as well as abundant time for self-directed, hands-on learning. Students also had opportunities to share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops. In addition, we organised weekly artist-talks/discussion groups for participants with invited guest speakers. Fun times!</p-->

					<p>We will work mainly with OpenFrameworks and Processing, but other platforms will also be incorporated such as Max/PureData and SuperCollider. Teachers and students will work together towards the production of individual or group projects and will have access to the equipment needed to create functioning responsive installations. Expect to play with code, be experimental and have fun! </p>
