 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of computer vision and image processing for creative projects and critical discourse.</p> 

    <p class="text">Computer Vision is an area of research centered on how algorithms can extract information from images. This was originally done using still images, later video and now includes 3D data from cameras with 3D sensors. </p>

   <iframe  width="640" height="360" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/145874219" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p class="text">Computer vision has found application in many areas: the military, video games,  police surveillance, robotics, etc. For artists and designers, computer vision can bring interactivity to works allowing reaction to body movement and motion, and allowing for the creation of new forms of imagery.</p> 

        <p class="text">Through the exploration of these technologies for creative purposes we’ll have the opportunity to see how these algorithms may be used for privacy and surveillance and what problems it might pose to use them within different contexts. In a time when access to cameras and sharing of imagery is commonplace, the possibility of analyzing or manipulating images allows for new forms of commentary and creativity.</p>

    <p class="text">This course will be taught using Openframeworks.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward anyone involved in creative projects (designers, makers, artists, musicians, performers etc.) that want to begin incorporating computer vision into their work or practice. The course approaches computer vision from an introductory level, however a basic knowledge of programming (in any language/platform) is encouraged.</p>

<h4 class="title">After taking this course, you'll walk away with

<p>Hands-on experience making interactive audio/visual works using openframeworks</p>
<p>A deeper understanding of the technologies behind surveillance and how you can 
intercept and engage with them in creative and subversive ways</p>
<p>An independent creative project for exhibition</p>

            <p class="text">Leo Castaneda (born Cali, Colombia 1988) is an artist based in Miami and New York working in the intersection of painting and virtual reality. He uses these among other mediums such as drawing, interactive sculpture, and animation to analyze and deconstruct the structures of video-games, and how these structures relate to those of Art and the world at large. </p>   

            <p class="text">Castaneda received his BFA from Cooper Union in 2010, and in 2014 received his MFA at Hunter College. In 2014 Castaneda received a scholarship from the Cisneros Foundation to attend SOMA Summer in Mexico City.  He has also attended a semester abroad in Universitat de Barcelona, Spain, and studied in New World School of the Arts in Miami.  </p>
