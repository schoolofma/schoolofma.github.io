      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>

      <p class="text">Augmented Reality is a medium compelling us to explore artistic creation, storytelling, and interactivity. The goal of this program is to approach AR as a creative platform to address social issues, imagine new forms of social engagement, and create social experiences that engage multiple users at a time.</p>
      <p class="text">The primary tools of this program will be Openframeworks and Unity 3D. We will also incorporate 3D, 360 video, video-tracking, and micro-controllers. As we engage the potential of these new tools, we will also take a critical perspective discussing the shortcomings and challenges of future technologies. No previous experience in augmented reality required.</p>

      <p class="text">We are all embedded in social systems, enabled and constrained by a tangle of relationships and interdependencies. In this program, we'll aim to examine social relations by reframing our environments as fragile ecosystems. </p>


      <p class="text">This will allow us to focus on narratives that offer new ways of understanding ourselves, other animals, plants, stones, habitats, ecosystems, and as super-communities made up of networked collectivity functioning as something more than the sum of its parts. </p>

      <p class="text">This summer, we attempt to go beyond that binary, inspiring a nuanced look at different styles of coexistence.</p>
