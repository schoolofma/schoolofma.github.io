      <p class="text">Future Landscapes is intensive four-week program created in collaboration with the Moore Institute at NUI Galway and Galway 2020.
</p>


      <p class="text">Compelling us all is an interest in creatively exploring landscapes in the physical world and of the mind while gaining an undderstanding of the potentials of mixed reality through a myriad of critical, conceptual, and hands-on approaches.</p>

       <p class="text">Mixed Reality can inspire new ways of looking at the world. Using new forms of interactive and tactile experiences, artistic creation and storytelling, what could we add or augment to our surroundings to develop new narratives about landscapes, be them physical, social, or mental, that permeate our lives?  What forms of play and togetherness might we be able to create and sustain? Could thoughtful discourse on landscapes and realities empower us into making impactful change?</p> 


      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>


      <p class="text">Mixed Reality (XR) refers to a suit of technologies that overlay computer generated imagery on top of the "real" world.  In addition to superimposing images and 3D models over the camera feed, these toolkits offer the opportunity to map physical spaces, understand ambient lighting and track the position of a phone in space. Pokemon Go used these techniques to capture the public interest and brought AR into the mainstream, but it begs the question, what else can we do with this technology? </p> 

      <p class="text">These techniques are just a starting point for what may be possible. There is much experimentation to be done by utilising the other capabilities of handheld devices to stream live data, communicate with others, and incorporate information from from built in sensors.</p>


      <p class="text">Although various types of augmented and virtual reality systems have existed for some time, recent advances in mobile technology platforms provide us more powerful ways of creating and sharing these experiences with a wider audience. So as the technology is advancing, what happens when we bring conceptual ideas and criticality to the fore?</p>

      <p class="text">The primary tool of this program will be Unity 3D. We will work with the ARKit and Vuforia libraries. As we engage the potential of these new tools, we will also take a critical perspective discussing the shortcomings and challenges of future technologies. </p>
