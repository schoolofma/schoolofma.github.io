      <p class="text">Pictoplasma and The School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe come together for the #CharaTech Contest: an initiative to unify character designers around the purpose of experimenting with interactive technology. The winner is offered a FREE MASTERCLASS of their choosing at the School of Machines. You can pick any 2018 summer course or wait for our 2019 programs. 

</p>

      <p class="text">
The challenge is to view your characters through the lens of creative and interactive technology. Entrants have four frames to tell a story that places their characters in a new world inspired by the upcoming programs of our school. </p>
