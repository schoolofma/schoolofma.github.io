  This art-driven class will focus on the creation of hand-made assets for virtual reality. In this program, we'll explore a variety of techniques for making digital assets for VR, through the lens of familiar studio art practices such as painting, drawing, photography, and sculpture.</p>

  <p class="text">Over the course of four weeks, we'll experiment with various ways traditional art practices can be integrated into digital asset production to achieve unexpected and experimental artifacts. 

  </p>

  <p class="text">The goal of this program is to leverage pre-existing artistic skills and interests with accessible software tools for asset creation, in order to creatively produce unique assets for use in virtual worlds.</p>

<h4 class="title">What will we do?</h4>


      <p class="text">Each week we will focus on an element of traditional studio art making, and explore how it can be integrated into a digital space like virtual reality. We will discuss the properties of each medium and look at existing works that can inform our weeks experiments.</p>

      <p class="text">We will spend time learning about some of the ways digital assets for vr are made, and become more familiar specific tools for asset creation. </p>

      <p class="text">We will spend time making physical works with the intention of bringing them into digital space. (One example of this could be painting our own landscapes for a virtual reality scene) </p>

      <p class="text">The desired outcome for this workshop is to populate a virtual reality space with the assets we create, and host a final show of our experiments in VR. </p>

  




    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This program is aimed at artists that have some experience with painting, drawing, photography, collage or sculpture, and are interested in learning about making things for virtual reality.</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/VAULTII.jpg" class="pic">

<p class="text">This workshop is for anyone that is excited by messiness, experimentation, conversation and collaboration. </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/i3.jpg" class="pic">

<p class="text">This is not a code based workshop, and there are no specific requirements for tech skills. However, someone already familiar with making assets for virtual reality or 3D animation might not benefit as greatly from this workshop. </p>




<!--h4 class="title">After taking this course, you'll walk away with
</h4>



<p>Hands-on experience making interactive audio/visual works using openframeworks</p>
<p>A deeper understanding of the technologies behind surveillance and how you can 
intercept and engage with them in creative and subversive ways</p>
<p>An independent creative project for exhibition</p-->
