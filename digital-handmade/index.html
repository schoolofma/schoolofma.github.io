       <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>

<p class="text">
  While technology is is often touted as the saviour of our grand future, without the possibility of artistic and creative expression with these new tools, much of this “innovation" would be virtually lifeless. The magic is in how the technology stimulates our curiosity and invites us to rethink possibilities and envision new worlds. </p>

<p class="text">This program will focus on that magic— artistic asset production- for use in our future imaginaries and virtual spaces.</p>

        <p class="text">
  This art-driven program will focus on the creation of hand-made assets for virtual reality. In this class, we'll explore a variety of techniques for making digital assets for VR, through the lens of familiar studio art practices such as painting, drawing, photography, and sculpture.</p>

  <p class="text">Over the course of four weeks, we'll experiment with various ways traditional art practices can be integrated into digital asset production to achieve unexpected and experimental artifacts. 

  </p>

  <p class="text">The goal of this program is to leverage pre-existing artistic skills and interests with accessible software tools for asset creation, in order to creatively produce unique assets for use in virtual worlds.</p>
