          <p class="text">Marie Claire LeBlanc Flanagan moved from Canada ​to​ Berlin one year ago to make experimental games. In the past year she has made “Auscault”, a facial recognition/biosignal experience using machine learning to allow you to play another person’s body as an instrument. “Other Hands”, a VR experience expressing the permanence of a person’s virtual choices on their physical body with permanent tattoos, “Closer”, a computer vision game that uses two people’s moving bodies as a shared single controller, and “TexTiles”, an award-winning game at the Wikimedia Free Knowledge Game Jam.</p> 

          <p class="text">Marie is the founder of Wyrd Arts Initiatives, a nationwide nonprofit dedicated to encouraging, documenting, and connecting creative expression across Canada. She is the editor in chief of Weird Canada and also created an international day for the celebration of drone music.​</p>

          <p class="text">Mike makes experimental games, interactive art, and software tools. Above all, he like to make things that spark intellectual curiosity and inspire people to become self-motivated learners.

          In the past, he's spent time in creative learning and research spaces such as the Recurse Center and the MIT Media Lab, where my research within the Playful Systems research group focused on storytelling at the intersection of experiential theatre, interactive fiction, and audio-based augmented reality.

          He has also worked with teams such as Words With Friends, Timehop, Sensible Object, Etsy, and Pivotal Labs. Currently, Mike is based in Berlin, Germany.</p>

            <p class="text">Niklas Roy is a self-proclaimed “inventor of useless things”. He uses art in order to explore technology. His researches result in mechanical sculptures, electric machines, interactive performances and electronic devices. 'We make money not art' once described him as one of the most facetious characters of the 'new media art' world. As part of his artistic practice, Roy also conducts workshops at festivals and art schools, often together with his partner Kati Hyyppä.</p>
