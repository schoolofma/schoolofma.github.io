<p class="text">This interactive cross stitch activity introduces those who are unfamiliar with technology to the Internet.  By connecting to an-on screen lesson, the object becomes a controller that advances the tutorial as each stitch is made, bridging the gap between analog and digital processes. Project by Alice Stewart.</p>

<p class="text"> Inspired by old model trains, Seduce the Train, a project by Kati Hyppa with Niklas Roy, is a two-person game played in turns, moving the train from one station to another. It was originally conceived at Eniarof, a pop-up fun fair concept by Antonin Fourneau.</p>

<p class="text">The Forbidden Fruit Machine is an interactive installation by Kati Hyppa with Niklas Roy. It is based on a painting called "The Fall of Man" created by Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem in 1592. The machine reinterprets the historical artwork in the form of a mechatronic video game, giving the spectator of the painting the chance to control the destiny of the forbidden apple with a joystick.</p>

<p class="text">Hello, Operator! is a game played on a vintage telephone switchboard from 1927, a refurbished Western Electric 551-A. You'll listen to callers using a vintage telephone handset, connect calls by physically connecting patch cables between ports, and receive feedback through a series of status lights. The game teaches you how to use the hardware exactly how it would have been used in 1927. Project by Mike Lazer-Walker.</p>

            <p class="text">Kati Hyyppä is a Berlin-based artist and educator from Finland who explores playful ways to connect with technology. Besides building electronic objects and installations, she also gives courses and workshops on topics ranging from low-tech robots and electromechanics to electronic textiles. Kati draws her inspiration from DIY culture, recycled electronics, popular science, traditional crafts and humorous storytelling. Creative use of openly licensed cultural content is also close to her heart. Embracing the open source movement, she publishes her documentation so that others can build upon it.</p>

          <p class="text">Mike makes experimental games, interactive art, and software tools. Above all, he like to make things that spark intellectual curiosity and inspire people to become self-motivated learners.

          In the past, he's spent time in creative learning and research spaces such as the Recurse Center and the MIT Media Lab, where my research within the Playful Systems research group focused on storytelling at the intersection of experiential theatre, interactive fiction, and audio-based augmented reality.

          He has also worked with teams such as Words With Friends, Timehop, Sensible Object, Etsy, and Pivotal Labs. Currently, Mike is based in Berlin, Germany.</p>

            <p class="text">Niklas Roy is a self-proclaimed “inventor of useless things”. He uses art in order to explore technology. His researches result in mechanical sculptures, electric machines, interactive performances and electronic devices. 'We make money not art' once described him as one of the most facetious characters of the 'new media art' world. As part of his artistic practice, Roy also conducts workshops at festivals and art schools, often together with his partner Kati Hyyppä.</p>
