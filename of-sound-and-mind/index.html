      <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

<p class="text">*Note: This program has evolved into a half lecture course, half residency program. In addition to attending our two-week intensive course, you have the option to continue your work here in a two-week intensive residency as you work towards the creation of a final project for exhibition.</p> 


    <p class="text">Augmented Ear Reality is a workshop led by sound artist Antoine Bertin and visual artist Helene Combal-Weiss. They meet in the design practice of sensorial experiences. Their hybrid creations merge auditory and tactile senses in the completion of objects, installation and participative experiments.</p> 

    

    <p class="text">Leading an exploration of materials, shapes, human body, binaural recordings, interactive audio, and listening practices, participants are taken on a journey to reveal new and unexpected sensations. </p>



      <p class="text">Our listening reality is intimate, tactile, spatial, social and temporal. Using creative, analog and digital means of bending the sense of hearing, students are invited to explore the idea of a sound-driven virtual reality. Listening through the ear, listening through skin, listening through bones: through the creation of wearable ‘ear accessories’, the group will devise original strategies of blurring the boundary between the virtual and the real.</p>

      <p class="text">This workshop will take you from the inticacies of the ear to the surface of the skin and the resonance of spaces on a journey through the new possibilities in sound experience design that have emerged through the boom of virtual reality. </p>

            <p class="text">Art Director and Installation Artist, Florence To designs and produces visual installations to create an awareness of the organized elements in architecture. After obtaining a Masters Degree in Design at The Glasgow School of Art, she began developing installations, working in a variety of disparate environments and tailoring each project to fit the space.</p>

            <p class="text">To has a background in classical music which led her to collaborate with sound designers for commissioned projects and performances including The Society of Arts and Technology in Montreal, Budapest institute 4DSOUND and Unsound in Kraków. She continues to explore the effects of live performance, through researching the creation of physical presence with light and how different sensory arrangements can create an emotional and psychological impact on the audience.</p>

            <p class="text">Antoine Bertin is an artist who listens his way around the boundaries between documentary and fiction, the poetic and the political, the living and the artificial. </p>

              <p class="text">His work consists of audio narratives combining elements of broadcast, walk, sculpture and publication. Weaving technology together with storytelling, he is curious about our relationship with the environment, the ‘unreachable’ and the idea of progress.</p>

              <p class="text">Born in 1985, trained as a sound engineer at ENS Louis Lumière and graduating with an MA in Sound Art from London College of Communication, Antoine currently works in London, Brussels and Paris.</p>
