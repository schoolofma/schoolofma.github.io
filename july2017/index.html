      <p class="text">Examining social relations by reframing our environments (social, physical or geopolitical) as ecosystems. Just as microbiomes are responsible for many of the processes and behaviors considered intrinsic to their hosts, we are all embedded in social systems, enabled and constrained by a tangle of relationships and interdependencies.</p>
      <p class="text">The goal of this program is to explore VR as a creative platform to address social issues, imagine new forms of social engagement, and create social experiences. </p>

      <p class="text">While technology is is often touted as the saviour of our grand future, without the possibility of artistic and creative expression with these new tools, much of this “innovation" would be virtually lifeless. The magic is in how the technology stimulates our curiosity and invites us to rethink possibilities and envision new worlds.</p>
      <p class="text">This program will focus on that magic— artistic asset production- for use in our future imaginaries and virtual spaces.</p>
