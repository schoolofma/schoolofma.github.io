  Examining social relations by reframing our environments (social, physical or geopolitical) as ecosystems. Just as microbiomes are responsible for many of the processes and behaviors considered intrinsic to their hosts, we are all embedded in social systems, enabled and constrained by a tangle of relationships and interdependencies.</p>

<p class="text">Such reframing allows us to focus on narratives that offer new ways of understanding ourselves, other animals, plants, stones, habitats and ecosystems, and as super-communities made up of networked collectivity functioning as something more than the sum of its parts. </p>

<p class="text">This summer, we attempt to go beyond that binary, inspiring a nuanced look at different styles of coexistence, at shifts in community variations and their influence, and to extend this framing to macro-scale communities and biomes. </p>




 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">Virtual Reality is a medium compelling us to explore artistic creation, storytelling, and interactivity. The goal of this program is to explore VR as a creative platform to address social issues, imagine new forms of social engagement and create social experiences.</p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/slippers.gif" class="pic">

    <p class="text">The primary tool of this program will be Unity 3D. We will also incorporate 3D, 360 video, video-tracking and micro-controllers.  As we engage the potential of these new tools, we will also take a critical perspective discussing the shortcomings and challenges.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward anyone involved in creative projects (designers, makers, artists, musicians, performers etc.) that wish to begin incorporating interactive virtual reality experiences into their work or practice. The course approaches VR from an introductory level, however a basic knowledge of programming (in any language/platform) is encouraged.</p>

  While technology is is often touted as the saviour of our grand future, without the possibility of artistic and creative expression with these new tools, much of this “innovation" would be virtually lifeless. The magic is in how the technology stimulates our curiosity and invites us to rethink possibilities and envision new worlds. </p>

<p class="text">This program will focus on that magic— artistic asset production- for use in our future imaginaries and virtual spaces.</p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">
  This art-driven program will focus on the creation of hand-made assets for virtual reality. In this class, we'll explore a variety of techniques for making digital assets for VR, through the lens of familiar studio art practices such as painting, drawing, photography, and sculpture.</p>

  <p class="text">Over the course of four weeks, we'll experiment with various ways traditional art practices can be integrated into digital asset production to achieve unexpected and experimental artifacts. 

  </p>

  <p class="text">The goal of this program is to leverage pre-existing artistic skills and interests with accessible software tools for asset creation, in order to creatively produce unique assets for use in virtual worlds.</p>

<h4 class="title">What will we do?</h4>


      <p class="text">Each week we will focus on an element of traditional studio art making, and explore how it can be integrated into a digital space for use in virtual reality. We will discuss the properties of each medium and look at existing works that can inform our weeks experiments.</p>

      <p class="text">Throughout the course we will learn various methods digital assets for VR are made, and become more familiar specific tools for asset creation. </p>

      <p class="text">We will spend time making physical works with the intention of bringing them into digital space. (One example of this could be painting our own landscapes for a virtual reality scene). </p>

      <p class="text">The desired outcome for this workshop is to populate a virtual reality space with the assets we create, and host a final show of our experiments in VR. </p>

  




    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This program is aimed at artists, creatives, and anyone who has some experience with painting, drawing, photography, collage or sculpture, (or wishes to!) and is interested in learning about making things with traditional tools for virtual reality.</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/VAULTII.jpg" class="pic">

<p class="text">For those excited by messiness, experimentation, conversation and collaboration, this is for you! Please note: This is not a code-based workshop, and there are no specific requirements as far as technical skills are concerned.</p>
