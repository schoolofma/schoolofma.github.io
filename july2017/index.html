<p class="text">
  Examining social relations by reframing our environments (social, physical or geopolitical) as ecosystems. Just as microbiomes are responsible for many of the processes and behaviors considered intrinsic to their hosts, we are all embedded in social systems in which are enabled and constrained by a tangle of relationships and interdependencies.</p>

<p class="text">Such reframing allows us to focus on narratives that offer new ways of understanding ourselves, other animals, plants, stones, habitats and ecosystems, as super-communities made up of networked collectivity functioning as something more than the sum of its parts. </p>

<p class="text">From the microscopic level of microbiomes - bacterial communities that render their host as an ecosystem, to digital communities or societies. We focus on consideration of how communities figure in our conception of what biosphere is and does. We ask to consider mutualisms and cocultures, contagion and virality, the spaces in-between that form in combinations of connections, interactions and relations. </p>

<p class="text">The term super-organism has been used to describe the host-microbiome assemblages, but ‘super-community’ might more accurately evoke the confusion of boundaries that interspecies collaborations suggest.</p>

<p class="text">The notion of superorganism evokes the uncanny. It requires seeing the familiar - yourself, your pet or your houseplant - as ‘strange’: as a community of interacting multitudes. </p>

<p class="text">This notion of “co-opted and infolded strangers” has been dominated in our collective imagination by portrayals of microbes as enemies, focusing entirely on the small minority of pathogens and parasites, and narratives of threat, death and disease (intuitions which were masterfully harnessed in the film Alien - in which the parasite aliens live inside earthlings, waiting to burst out.) In the last couple decades however, the tide has been turning. </p>

<p class="text">We’ve turned our attention to the beneficial microbes that contribute to and sometimes entirely account for abilities of their hosts, resulting in claims that probiotics can solve everything from indigestion to aquatic remediation. 

<p class="text">This summer, we attempt to go beyond that binary, inspiring a nuanced look at different styles of coexistence, at shifts in community variations and their influence, and to extend this framing to macro-scale communities and biomes.

  Computer vision is a responsive, interactive, and exciting tool for realising creative vision.
  From tracking body movements to face detection and pixel manipulation, computer vision is a rich area that opens up many new possibilities. Low cost cameras and open source platforms now make this field much more accessible allowing us to introduce powerful algorithmic approaches to our creative endeavors. </p>

  <p class="text">These kinds of technologies are also pervasive in our daily lives and understanding their inner workings will allow us to challenge and play with them in creative and subversive ways.

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">Virtual Reality is a medium to explore artistic creation, storytelling, and interactivity. The goal of this program is to explore VR as a creative platform to address social issues, imagine new forms of social engagement and create social experiences.</p>

    <p class="text">The workshop will use Unity 3D as the primary tool but may also incorporate Blender, 360 video, video-tracking and micro-controllers.  As we engage the potential of these new tools, we will also take a critical perspective discussing the shortcomings and challenges.</p>

  This art-driven class will focus on the creation of hand-made assets for virtual reality. In this program, we'll explore a variety of techniques for making digital assets for VR, through the lens of familiar studio art practices such as painting, drawing, photography, and sculpture.</p>

  <p class="text">Over the course of four weeks, we'll experiment with various ways traditional art practices can be integrated into digital asset production to achieve unexpected and experimental artifacts. 

  </p>

  <p class="text">The goal of this program is to leverage pre-existing artistic skills and interests with accessible software tools for asset creation, in order to creatively produce unique assets for use in virtual worlds.</p>

<h4 class="title">What will we do?</h4>


      <p class="text">Each week we will focus on an element of traditional studio art making, and explore how it can be integrated into a digital space like virtual reality. We will discuss the properties of each medium and look at existing works that can inform our weeks experiments.</p>

      <p class="text">We will spend time learning about some of the ways digital assets for vr are made, and become more familiar specific tools for asset creation. </p>

      <p class="text">We will spend time making physical works with the intention of bringing them into digital space. (One example of this could be painting our own landscapes for a virtual reality scene) </p>

      <p class="text">The desired outcome for this workshop is to populate a virtual reality space with the assets we create, and host a final show of our experiments in VR. </p>

<p class="text">This program is aimed at artists that have some experience with painting, drawing, photography, collage or sculpture, and are interested in learning about making things for virtual reality.</p>

<p class="text">This workshop is for anyone that is excited by messiness, experimentation, conversation and collaboration. </p>

<p class="text">This is not a code based workshop, and there are no specific requirements for tech skills. However, someone already familiar with making assets for virtual reality or 3D animation might not benefit as greatly from this workshop. </p>
