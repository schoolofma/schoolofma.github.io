<p class="text">
  Examining social relations by reframing our environments (social, physical or geopolitical) as ecosystems. Just as microbiomes are responsible for many of the processes and behaviors considered intrinsic to their hosts, we are all embedded in social systems in which are enabled and constrained by a tangle of relationships and interdependencies.</p>

<p class="text">Such reframing allows us to focus on narratives that offer new ways of understanding ourselves, other animals, plants, stones, habitats and ecosystems, as super-communities made up of networked collectivity functioning as something more than the sum of its parts. </p>

<p class="text">From the microscopic level of microbiomes - bacterial communities that render their host as an ecosystem, to digital communities or societies. We focus on consideration of how communities figure in our conception of what biosphere is and does. We ask to consider mutualisms and cocultures, contagion and virality, the spaces in-between that form in combinations of connections, interactions and relations. </p>

<p class="text">The term super-organism has been used to describe the host-microbiome assemblages, but ‘super-community’ might more accurately evoke the confusion of boundaries that interspecies collaborations suggest.</p>

<p class="text">The notion of superorganism evokes the uncanny. It requires seeing the familiar - yourself, your pet or your houseplant - as ‘strange’: as a community of interacting multitudes. </p>

<p class="text">This notion of “co-opted and infolded strangers” has been dominated in our collective imagination by portrayals of microbes as enemies, focusing entirely on the small minority of pathogens and parasites, and narratives of threat, death and disease (intuitions which were masterfully harnessed in the film Alien - in which the parasite aliens live inside earthlings, waiting to burst out.) In the last couple decades however, the tide has been turning. </p>

<p class="text">We’ve turned our attention to the beneficial microbes that contribute to and sometimes entirely account for abilities of their hosts, resulting in claims that probiotics can solve everything from indigestion to aquatic remediation. 

<p class="text">This summer, we attempt to go beyond that binary, inspiring a nuanced look at different styles of coexistence, at shifts in community variations and their influence, and to extend this framing to macro-scale communities and biomes.

  Computer vision is a responsive, interactive, and exciting tool for realising creative vision.
  From tracking body movements to face detection and pixel manipulation, computer vision is a rich area that opens up many new possibilities. Low cost cameras and open source platforms now make this field much more accessible allowing us to introduce powerful algorithmic approaches to our creative endeavors. </p>

  <p class="text">These kinds of technologies are also pervasive in our daily lives and understanding their inner workings will allow us to challenge and play with them in creative and subversive ways.

 </p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of computer vision and image processing for creative projects and critical discourse.</p> 

    <p class="text">Computer Vision is an area of research centered on how algorithms can extract information from images. This was originally done using still images, later video and now includes 3D data from cameras with 3D sensors. </p>

   <iframe  width="640" height="360" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p class="text">Computer vision has found application in many areas: the military, video games,  police surveillance, robotics, etc. For artists and designers, computer vision can bring interactivity to works allowing reaction to body movement and motion, and allowing for the creation of new forms of imagery.</p> 

        <p class="text">Through the exploration of these technologies for creative purposes we’ll have the opportunity to see how these algorithms may be used for privacy and surveillance and what problems it might pose to use them within different contexts. In a time when access to cameras and sharing of imagery is commonplace, the possibility of analyzing or manipulating images allows for new forms of commentary and creativity.</p>

    <p class="text">This course will be taught using Openframeworks.</p>

    <iframe src="" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward anyone involved in creative projects (designers, makers, artists, musicians, performers etc.) that want to begin incorporating computer vision into their work or practice. The course approaches computer vision from an introductory level, however a basic knowledge of programming (in any language/platform) is encouraged.</p>

            <p class="text">Laura is interested in weird human interactions and their impact on the subconscious. For MASK, her Master’s Thesis, she made a series of customized virtual reality headsets. Each mask has its own VR experience and physical functions for the purpose of overcoming communication difficulties. Participants empower themselves by wearing different versions of MASK, as an approach to one of Laura’s abiding questions: how can one change a person’s perspective by changing their perception?</p>

            <p class="text">Laura uses open-source technologies and a low-tech approach to create lighthearted and publicly accessible experiences. Recently, she has exhibited her works at De Brakke Grond, Amsterdam, Museum of the Moving Image, Grand Central Terminal, and Time Squares in New York City, and has given workshops and talks at the Queens Museum, and the IDFA DocLab.</p>

  This art-driven class will focus on making hand-made assets for virtual reality. In this program, we'll explore a variety of techniques for making digital assets for VR, all of which will be taught through the lens of familiar studio art practices like painting, drawing, photography and sculpture.</p>

  <p class="text">Over the course of four weeks, we'll experiment with ways traditional art practices can be integrated into digital asset production to make unexpected and experimental artifacts. 

  </p>

  <p class="text">The goal of this class is to leverage pre-existing artistic skills or interests with accessible software tools for asset creation, in order to make creative, charming and totally unique assets for use in virtual worlds.</p>

<h4 class="title">What will we do?</h4>


      <p class="text">Each week we will focus on an element of traditional studio art making, and explore how it can be integrated into a digital space like virtual reality. We will discuss the properties of each medium and look at existing works that can inform our weeks experiments.</p>

      <p class="text">We will spend time learning about some of the ways digital assets for vr are made, and become more familiar specific tools for asset creation. </p>

      <p class="text">We will spend time making physical works with the intention of bringing them into digital space. (One example of this could be painting our own landscapes for a virtual reality scene) </p>

      <p class="text">The desired outcome for this workshop is to populate a virtual reality space with the assets we create, and host a final show of our experiments in VR. </p>

<p class="text">This workshop is for anyone that is excited by messiness, experimentation, conversation and collaboration. </p>

<p class="text">This is not a code based workshop, and there are no specific requirements for tech skills. However, someone already familiar with making assets for virtual reality or 3D animation might not benefit as greatly from this workshop. </p>
