      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>

      <p class="text">How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories by making things move?  This course will focus on physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of emerging technologies, and how they can work seemlessly together to help you express yourself artistically in both thoughtful and nonsensical ways.</p>

      <p class="text">instructors and students will take a hands-on approach to working with basic electronic components, sensors and motors as well as with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, using these tools to play and to create magical things that move!</p>

<p class="text">This interactive cross stitch activity introduces those who are unfamiliar with technology to the Internet.  By connecting to an-on screen lesson, the object becomes a controller that advances the tutorial as each stitch is made, bridging the gap between analog and digital processes.
