      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>

      <p class="text">Physical computing is a subject area that brings hardware and software together, usually through the application of microcontrollers, to make interactive things using a combination of sensors and outputs. The course will focus on physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of emerging technologies, and how they can work seamlessly together to create unique prototypes, products and experiences. Complex fields such as electronics, engineering and computer science will be demystified and explored as creative tools of endless possibility!</p>

      <p class="text">In today’s increasingly digitised world, how is the physical human experience relevant, meaningful, even political? The course will cover the entire process of making a physical computing project from start to finish. This will include exercises for idea generation, rapid prototyping, basic electronics (including printed circuit board design), creative mechanics and introductory coding skills. Students will learn how to build controllers and interfaces that can connect to and endless range of outputs. What you decide to make is up to you and your creative expression!</p>

      <p class="text">Students will take a hands-on approach to working with basic electronic components, sensors and motors, using the Arduino platform as a base to play and to create magical things that bring ideas to life through interactivity. This course is for people who have always wanted to delve into the world of physical computing but have never been sure of where to start. It is a month-long intensive that will equip you with the technical expertise and confidence to continue working on your own projects long after the course has ended.</p>

<p class="text">This interactive cross stitch activity introduces those who are unfamiliar with technology to the Internet.  By connecting to an-on screen lesson, the object becomes a controller that advances the tutorial as each stitch is made, bridging the gap between analog and digital processes.
