    <p class="text">Winners and Losers is an intensive four-week program led by creative artists and educators Alice Stewart, Mike Lazer-Walker, and returning favourites Kati Hyppä and Niklas Roy.


    <p class="text">Children grow up with a playful instinct. We learn to relate to, interact with and understand other humans through ‘games’. These games teach us notions of competition and cooperation that help acclimatize us to the adult world. Wrapped up in the idea of a game is frequently a notion of winning or losing. How does this conception trickle into our adult psyches and affect the social, economic and physical infrastructure we co-create?</p>

    <p class="text">Through world-building, and the creation of interactive and tactile experiences, we will create experimental games in the form of physical artifacts and installations. To do this, we will use both hardware and software to sense and respond to the environment around us as we set out to envision new societies and new modalities of play that might exist within them.</p>

      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>

      <p class="text">In this program we will take a closer look at how competition and cooperation, experienced through games, plays into our lives and our conception of the world, as we set out to prototype playful experiences and create physical, embodied, and experimental games.</p>

      <p class="text">Social networks, service providers and even employers are increasingly ‘gamifying’ interfaces and feedback systems to encourage attention and manage labour. At the same time creative communities, from escape room designers to producers of immersive theatre, are developing new types of participatory, playful experiences rooted physical spaces.</p>

      <p class="text">The time is ripe not simply to push the boundaries of what a game is but also to explore the assumptions and attitudes encapsulated in our shared concept of a ‘game’.</p>

      <p class="text">In pursuit of these goals, this course will focus on physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of electronics and repurposed materials. You will be introduced to programming for microcontrollers and mini-computers as well as adapting found objects and appliances in playful ways. We will learn how these approaches can work together and empower you to create interactive devices and artifacts, which can support playful interactions with your audience.</p>

<p class="text">This interactive cross stitch activity introduces those who are unfamiliar with technology to the Internet.  By connecting to an-on screen lesson, the object becomes a controller that advances the tutorial as each stitch is made, bridging the gap between analog and digital processes.
