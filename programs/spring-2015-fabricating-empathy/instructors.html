								<p class="text">beanotherlab is an international, interdisciplinary collective dedicated
												to investigate embodied and telepresence experiments. We believe that
												the understanding of the “self” is related to the understanding of the
												“Other” and that more than individuals, we are part of a broader system
												called humanity. Under this perspective, we search for innovative
												possibilities on the concepts of embodied interaction, extended body and
												extended mind by mixing low-budget digital technology with social
												relations, Web and neuroscience methodologies.</p>

								<p class="text">We develop Creative Commons tools based on Open Knowledge and are
												collaborating with experimental psychologists and neuroscientists to
												develop usage procedures to ‘the machine’ as a low-budget rehabilitation
												system, and also as an immersive role playing system.</p>

												in the Interactive Telecommunication Program from New York
												University (ITP). Since then, she has been experimenting
												making toys, wearables, mechanisms and physical computing
												projects. After she graduated, she has been working as part
												of the team YesYesNo, which specializes in interactive art
												installations. She builds and designs the physical aspects
												of every project, producing digital and physical 3D models,
												prototyping and fabricating unique pieces.</p>

								<h5 class="name">Sitraka Rakotoniaina <span class="sub web">/&nbsp;<a href="http://sitraka.co.uk" target="_blank">sitraka.co.uk</a></span></h5>
								<p class="text">Born in Madagascar and raised in Paris, Sitraka currently lives and works in London. He is an Artist and Designer whose body of works ranges from fictional science experiments to speculative objects and devices. His work explores our relation to science and technology, encompassing cultural and social implications, as well as the beliefs and values intrinsic to their development. With a focus on the possibility of transforming individual sensory experiences, Sitraka often uses the human body as vehicle to trigger people’s imagination. </p>

								<p class="text">He ‘crafts’ narratives through the conception and fabrication of objects and uses their ‘aesthetic’ qualities and theatricality as the foundations enabling a physical form of storytelling. Sitraka studied Industrial Design and Graphic Design/Multimedia in Paris, and graduated from the Design Interactions course at the Royal College of Art. He has worked as an independent Interaction Designer since 2006 and is currently represented by Nexus Interactive Arts as a Director on their roster. </p>

								<p class="text">His work has been shown internationally including venues such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, Venice Architecture Biennale, Saint-Etienne design Biennial, the Art Center College of Design. And recognised through awards and publications including D&AD, we-make-money-not-art, Axis Magazine, See Yourself Sensing by Madeline Schwartzman, Design and Violence by the MoMA, etc.</p>

								<h5 class="name">Andrew Friend <span class="sub web">/&nbsp;<a href="http://www.andrewfriend.co.uk/" target="_blank">andrewfriend.co.uk/</a></span></h5>	
										<p class="text">Andrew Friend  is an artist and designer who’s work explores experience, and the relationship between people, landscape, and their desires. He is interested in the extraordinary, fantastic and desirable (or indeed undesirable) experiences and outcomes that may result from these interactions. His work spans a range of media, through narrative and drawings to large scale physical objects designed to promote, facilitate, and question these experiences, examining relationships between the known and unknown, the real and imagined in the individual quest to harness the sublime.
		 								</p>
										<p class="text">Andrew holds an MA in Design Interactions from the Royal College of Art, London and is currently Associate Lecturer in
										the department of Spatial Practices, Central St Martins, University of the Arts London, and department of design, Goldsmiths College, University of London.
