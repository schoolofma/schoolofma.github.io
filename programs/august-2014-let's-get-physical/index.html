			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories by making things move?  This course will focus on physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of new technologies, digital fabrication (3D printing, laser-cutting) and how they can work seemlessly together to help you express yourself artistically in both thoughtful and/or non-sensical ways.</p>
			<p>Teachers and students will take a hands-on approach to working with basic electronic components, sensors and motors as well as with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, learning to use these tools to play and to create magical things that move! Robots and wearable technology will also be explored in this course.</p>

			<h3>Plan</h3>
			<p>No previous experience necessary. You will learn your way around electronics, 3D printing, and using sensors and motors to make things move. We will touch on topics such as wearable technology and coding in an atmosphere that caters to artists and those interested in exploring art, creativity and interactivity. Plus it will be fun!</p>
			<p>Throughout the program there will be time for interesting exercises, collaboration, and even outside excursions — it will be summertime in Berlin, after all! We’ll also have guest speakers and artist talks mixed in throughout the program.</p>

			<h4>1st week</h4>
			<p>The first week is dedicated to getting familiar with tools: basics of electronics, programming microcontrollers, and an introduction to Processing and the Arduino IDE.  It’s also the time for everyone to get to know each other and explore ideas and concepts surrounding art, technology, interactivity, and storytelling.  We’ll start to examine some questions, such as: what is the purpose of electronics in art? How can interactivity help convey a concept? How can sensors and motors become not only devices, but critical tools in storytelling? Main instructors will be <a href="#caitlin-morris">Caitlin Morris</a>, <a href="#louisa-heinrich">Louisa Heinrich</a>, and <a href="#stefania-druga">Stefania Druga</a>.</p>
			<h4>2nd & 3rd weeks</h4>
			<p>The following two weeks are a bit more intensive, building on the previous week’s topics and focusing on getting more hands-on with tools for digital fabrication (3D modeling, 3D printing, etc). You’ll also explore wearables, using sensors to detect the world around you, and start to make things move with motors and other actuators.  Expect several engaging workshops from various artists and technologists including <a href="#so-kanno">So Kanno</a>, <a href="#yang02">Yang02</a>, <a href="#becky-stewart">Becky Stewart</a> and <a href="#anaisa-franco">Anaisa Franco</a>. But wait, there's more! The third week will be dedicated to the making of unique and playful robots with the unique and playful duo <a href="#kati-hyppa">Kati Hyppä</a> and <a href="#niklas-roy">Niklas Roy</a>! 
			<h4>4th weeks</h4>
			<p>The final week is dedicated to putting together your new skills and further developing projects to be showcased at the final event.</p>
