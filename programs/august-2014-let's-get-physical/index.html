			<h3 class="title">Let's Get Physical<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjRA0vCV8iw" target="_blank">!</a> <span class="sub warning">/ August 2014</span></h3><a name="July"></a>
			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories by making things move?  This course will focus on physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of new technologies, digital fabrication (3D printing, laser-cutting) and how they can work seemlessly together to help you express yourself artistically in both thoughtful and/or non-sensical ways.</p>
			<p>Teachers and students will take a hands-on approach to working with basic electronic components, sensors and motors as well as with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, learning to use these tools to play and to create magical things that move! </p>
