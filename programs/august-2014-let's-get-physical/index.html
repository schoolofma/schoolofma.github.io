			<h3 class="title">Let's Get Physical: The Details<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjRA0vCV8iw" target="_blank">!</a> <span class="sub warning">/ 04 - 29 August 2014</span></h3>

			
			<p>This program is divided into four weeks.  The first week is dedicated to getting familiar with tools: basics of electronics, programming microcontrollers, and an introduction to Processing.  It’s also the time for everyone to get to know each other and explore ideas and concepts surrounding art, technology, interactivity, and storytelling.  We’ll start to examine some questions, such as: what is the purpose of electronics in art? How can interactivity help convey a concept? How can sensors and motors become not only devices, but critical tools in storytelling? Main instructors will be Caitlin Morris, Louisa Heinrich, and Stefania Druga.</p>
			<p>The following two weeks are a bit more intensive, building on the previous week’s topics and focusing on getting more hands-on with tools for digital fabrication (3D modeling, 3D printing, etc).  You’ll also explore using sensors to detect the world around you, and start to make things move with motors and other actuators.  Expect several engaging workshops from various artists and technologists including So Kanno, Yang02, Becky Stewart and Anaisa Franco. But wait, there's more! The third week will be dedicated to the making of unique and playful robots with the unique and playful duo Kati Hyppä and Niklas Roy! The final week is dedicated to putting together your new skills and further developing projects to be showcased at the final event.</p>
			<p>Throughout the program there will be time for interesting exercises, collaboration, and even outside excursions — it will be summertime in Berlin, after all! We’ll also have guest speakers and artist talks mixed in throughout the program. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZlwObVR731vCtswdFUE1vqUVln0WrYRoBx9qZuZD2ao/viewform" target="_blank">Join us!</a></p>
