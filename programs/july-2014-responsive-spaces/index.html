			<h3 class="title">Responsive Spaces <span class="sub warning">/ July 2014</span></h3>
			
			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories with code? This course will focus on creative coding and interactivity in the context of responsive spaces. The goal is to explore the creative and expressive possibilities of new technologies and digital tools and sensors while gaining a foundation in creative coding (algorithmic animation, computer vision, audio analysis and synthesis, projection mapping, networks, and 3D graphics).</p>
			<p>We will work mainly with OpenFrameworks and Processing, but other platforms will also be incorporated such as Max/PureData and SuperCollider. Teachers and students will work together towards the production of individual or group projects and will have access to the equipment needed to create functioning responsive installations. Expect to play with code, be experimental and have fun!</p>

						<p class="text">S. Astrid Bin&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;interdisciplinary artist, designer and&nbsp;creative technologist. Her&nbsp;work examines the&nbsp;poetry in&nbsp;everyday things and&nbsp;the connections between people and&nbsp;their environments. She&nbsp;also folds technology into the&nbsp;fabric of&nbsp;the&nbsp;work she&nbsp;makes. She works two&nbsp;dimensionally (works on&nbsp;paper, text pieces, photography, printed projects, interfaces), three dimensionally (installation, art&nbsp;in&nbsp;public spaces, and&nbsp;reactive objects), and&nbsp;four dimensionally (sound, video, performance and&nbsp;interactive works). As&nbsp;an&nbsp;art&nbsp;and&nbsp;technology researcher, she applies an&nbsp;art-based approach to&nbsp;design and&nbsp;engineering problems spanning interfaces, public space, new&nbsp;uses for&nbsp;games, the&nbsp;role of&nbsp;fun in&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;use, and re-imagining the&nbsp;music performing and&nbsp;listening experience.</p>
