						<p class="text">When Brent was a kid, he wanted to be a tractor. That didn’t work out, and now he’s a designer, musician, and educator based in Austin, TX. He's spent the last several years working with groups like Singularity University, TEDxAustin, Hackidemia, The Cooperative Food Empowerment Directive, The Filene Research Institute, and PBS Kids to create positive change though community, creativity, and tomfoolery.</p> 
						<p class="text">He's currently researching interactive technology and music therapy at the University of Texas. You can check out some of his original music at http://brentdixon.bandcamp.com.</p

						<h5 class="name"><a name="diogo-queirós">Diogo Queirós </a> <span class="sub web">/&nbsp;<a href="" target="_blank"></a></span></h5>
						<p class="text">Diogo is from Portugal. His background is in graphic design, but his inspirations come from music and cinema. He worked in the field for many years, doing everything you can imagine (from corporate identities, product/packaging to web and video) for high-profile clients (from hospitals to wine makers). He then got to place, where the tools were blocking his ideas, so he decided to make a change and make his own. For almost a year he’s been learning all about coding and interactive platforms.</p> 
						<p class="text">At this moment, his two main interests are: shaders (to express himself visually) and new experiences (finding new paradigms for the way we interact with our surroundings and ourselves).</p>

						<p class="text">Taseenb (Esteban Almiron) is a designer and developer based in Paris, with a background in art and cinema studies. He has worked for several companies in Milan and Paris, as director assistant, graphic designer and developer, but his obsessions always went far beyond communication and paying the rent.</p>
						<p class="text">His thesis (University of Bologna, Italy) was based on the unexpected connections between mainstream cinema and the French philosophers criticism of our vision society: control, spectacle, feminism were the main subjects. In recent years, he’s started to develop a more artistic approach which has brought him closer to the digital art scene. Today he tries to rethink his ideas on art, design and how they interrelate by experimenting with code and digital media tools.</p

			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories with code? This course will focus on creative coding and interactivity in the context of responsive spaces. The goal is to explore the creative and expressive possibilities of new technologies and digital tools and sensors while gaining a foundation in creative coding (algorithmic animation, computer vision, audio analysis and synthesis, projection mapping, networks, and 3D graphics).</p>

			<p>We will work mainly with OpenFrameworks and Processing, but other platforms will also be incorporated such as Max/PureData and SuperCollider. Teachers and students will work together towards the production of individual or group projects and will have access to the equipment needed to create functioning responsive installations. Expect to play with code, be experimental and have fun! </p>

			<h3>Plan</h3>
			<p>Throughout the program, there will be time for interesting exercises, collaborations, and even outside excursions — it will be summertime in Berlin, after all!  Not only that, we’ll also have guest speakers and artist talks alongside the base classes and workshops.</p>
			<p>The program begins at 10am every morning with an Core Programming course which runs a few hours long, followed by a lunch break, collaborative worktime and an afternoon lab session. Some days there will be more on the schedule particularly the first two weeks. Four weeks will go by quickly and we want to provide as much content and opportunities for creative hands-on learning as possible!</p>
			<p>We will be doing group check-ins so that students can voice where they would like more help and focus. Fridays will be a bit more experimental with guest lectures and other outside activities. We will provide as many opportunities for engagement as possible, with creative exercises and group activities. We believe in learning by doing and in having fun!</p>
			<h4>1st week</h4>
			<p>Getting familiar with your tools: the basics of programming. It’s also the time for everyone to get to know each other and to explore ideas and concepts surrounding art, technology, interactivity, and storytelling.  Along with core coding classes, we’ll examine and explore questions about the purpose of technology in art.  What kinds of conceptual expression are made possible through programming? How can interactivity be used to tell your stories? Main instructors during this first week will be <a href="#arturo-castro">Arturo Castro</a>, <a href="#abe-pazos">Abe Pazos</a>, <a href="#anrick-bregman">Anrick Bregman</a>, <a href="#astrid-bin">S. Astrid Bin</a>, and <a href="#raphaël-de-courville">Raphaël de Courville</a>.</p>
			<h4>2nd & 3rd weeks</h4>
			<p>Main focus will be on getting more hands-on with tools like Processing and openFrameworks.  By week three, we'll be delving more into Interactive aspects of programming and animation. We’ll also explore using sensors to detect the world around you, and delve into sound synthesis with frameworks like Max/MSP, Pure Data, and SuperCollider. Main instructors during this time will be Abe Pazos, Arturo Castro, and Chris Sugrue.  We’ll also be joined for a hands-on workshop by heart chamber orchestra mastermind <a href="#peter-pure-votava">Peter Votava</a>!</p>
		
			<h4>4th week</h4>
			<p>The final week is dedicated to advanced interaction and further development of projects, both collaborative and individual, to be showcased at the final event.</p>

As&nbsp;an&nbsp;art&nbsp;and&nbsp;technology researcher, she applies an&nbsp;art-based approach to&nbsp;design and&nbsp;engineering problems spanning interfaces, public space, new&nbsp;uses for&nbsp;games, the&nbsp;role of&nbsp;fun in&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;use, and re-imagining the&nbsp;music performing and&nbsp;listening experience.</p>
