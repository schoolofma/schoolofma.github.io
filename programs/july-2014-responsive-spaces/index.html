			<h3 class="title">Responsive Spaces <span class="sub warning">/ July 2014</span></h3>
			
			<p>How can we&nbsp;create meaningful interactive experiences or&nbsp;tell stories with code? This course will focus on&nbsp;creative coding and interactivity in&nbsp;the context of&nbsp;responsive spaces. The goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;explore the creative and expressive possibilities of&nbsp;new technologies and digital tools and sensors while gaining a&nbsp;foundation in&nbsp;creative coding (algorithmic animation, computer vision, audio analysis and synthesis, projection mapping, networks, and 3D&nbsp;graphics).</p>
			<p>We&nbsp;will work mainly with OpenFrameworks and Processing, but other platforms will also be&nbsp;incorporated such as&nbsp;Max/PureData and SuperCollider. Teachers and students will work together towards the production of&nbsp;individual or&nbsp;group projects and will have access to&nbsp;the equipment needed to&nbsp;create functioning responsive installations. Expect to play with code, be&nbsp;experimental and have fun!</p>

			<h3 class="title">The Details <span class="sub warning"></span></h3>
			
			<p>This program is divided into four weeks.  The first week is dedicated to getting familiar with your tools: the basics of programming. It’s also the time for everyone to get to know each other and to explore ideas and concepts surrounding art, technology, interactivity, and storytelling.  We’ll examine and explore questions about the purpose of technology in art.  What kinds of conceptual expression are made possible through programming? How can interactivity be used to tell your stories? Main instructors during this first week will be Anrick Bregman, S. Astrid Bin, and Raphael de Courville.</p>

			<p>The following two weeks are a bit more intensive, focusing on getting more hands-on with tools like Processing and openFrameworks.  We’ll explore using sensors to detect the world around you, and delve into sound synthesis with frameworks like Max/MSP, Pure Data, and SuperCollider. Main instructors during this time will be Abe Pazos, Arturo Castro, and Chris Sugrue.  We’ll also be joined for a hands-on workshop by heart chamber orchestra mastermind Peter Votava!</p>

			<p>Throughout the program, there will be time for interesting exercises, collaborations, and even outside excursions — it will be summertime in Berlin, after all!  Not only that, we’ll also have guest speakers and artist talks alongside the base classes and workshops.  Irina Spicake and Krisjanis Rijnieks will lead a great workshop on projection mapping using Madmapper.  The Graffiti Research Lab Germany crew will also be on hand to give a talk and workshop, and we will have an opportunity to join them and the Light Rider, tagging the streets of Berlin. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZlwObVR731vCtswdFUE1vqUVln0WrYRoBx9qZuZD2ao/viewform" target="_blank">Join us!</a></p>

						<p class="text">S. Astrid Bin&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;interdisciplinary artist, designer and&nbsp;creative technologist. Her&nbsp;work examines the&nbsp;poetry in&nbsp;everyday things and&nbsp;the connections between people and&nbsp;their environments. She&nbsp;also folds technology into the&nbsp;fabric of&nbsp;the&nbsp;work she&nbsp;makes. She works two&nbsp;dimensionally (works on&nbsp;paper, text pieces, photography, printed projects, interfaces), three dimensionally (installation, art&nbsp;in&nbsp;public spaces, and&nbsp;reactive objects), and&nbsp;four dimensionally (sound, video, performance and&nbsp;interactive works). As&nbsp;an&nbsp;art&nbsp;and&nbsp;technology researcher, she applies an&nbsp;art-based approach to&nbsp;design and&nbsp;engineering problems spanning interfaces, public space, new&nbsp;uses for&nbsp;games, the&nbsp;role of&nbsp;fun in&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;use, and re-imagining the&nbsp;music performing and&nbsp;listening experience.</p>
