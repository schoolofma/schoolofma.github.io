			<h3 class="title">Responsive Spaces: The Details <span class="sub warning">/ 30 June - 25 July 2014</span></h3>
			
			<p>This program is divided into four weeks.  The first week is dedicated to getting familiar with your tools: the basics of programming. It’s also the time for everyone to get to know each other and to explore ideas and concepts surrounding art, technology, interactivity, and storytelling.  We’ll examine and explore questions about the purpose of technology in art.  What kinds of conceptual expression are made possible through programming? How can interactivity be used to tell your stories? Main instructors during this first week will be Anrick Bregman, S. Astrid Bin, and Raphael de Courville.</p>

			<p>The following two weeks are a bit more intensive, focusing on getting more hands-on with tools like Processing and openFrameworks.  We’ll explore using sensors to detect the world around you, and delve into sound synthesis with frameworks like Max/MSP, Pure Data, and SuperCollider. Main instructors during this time will be Abe Pazos, Arturo Castro, and Chris Sugrue.  We’ll also be joined for a hands-on workshop by heart chamber orchestra mastermind Peter Votava!</p>

			<p>Throughout the program, there will be time for interesting exercises, collaborations, and even outside excursions — it will be summertime in Berlin, after all!  Not only that, we’ll also have guest speakers and artist talks alongside the base classes and workshops.  Irina Spicaka and Krisjanis Rijnieks will lead a great workshop on projection mapping using Madmapper.  The Graffiti Research Lab Germany crew will also be on hand to give a talk and workshop, and we will have an opportunity to join them and the Light Rider, tagging the streets of Berlin. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZlwObVR731vCtswdFUE1vqUVln0WrYRoBx9qZuZD2ao/viewform" target="_blank">Join us!</a></p>
