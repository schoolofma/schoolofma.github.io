<p class="text">Autonomous Generative Spirit is an intensive four-week program led by artists Gene Kogan and Andreas Refsgaard.</p> 

        <p class="text">In this program, we'll examine the ethical and sociocultural dimensions of machine learning, and discuss the coming issues which are sure to be preceded by the ever-increasing integration of these thinking machines into our daily lives.</p>

     <p class="text">Made In China is an intensive four-week program led by artists and creative technologists from London-based VVFA and Automato Farm based in Shanghai, China.</p>


     <p class="text">The aim of this program is to enable a hands-on creative exploration of digital fabrication and Internet-of-Things connected devices, while gaining deeper insight into China's cultural surroundings from an inside perspective. What are the implications of a society that can manufacture any new product on demand?  What can we learn from such an approach to society and to life?</p>



      <p class="text">Throughout the workshop we will explore critical and speculative design processes, enabling us to develop narratives, and tangible, accessible artefacts, experiences and environments with which to communicate and engage wider audiences with new possible futures.</p>


      <p class="text">Note: This program will be taking place in two cities. The first two weeks will be in Shanghai, China, while the third and fourth weeks of the program will take place in Shenzhen, China. This is in order to utilise Seeed fabrication facilities located in Shenzhen.
