		<p>The School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe will be hosting not one, but two Summer programs in 2014!</p>

		<p> Classes will be a mix of lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, technologists and educators, as well as abundant time for self-directed, hands-on learning. Students will also have opportunities to share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops. In addition, we'll organise weekly artist-talks/discussion groups for participants with invited guest speakers. And if you're really lucky, just for fun, we may do something that looks a lot like this:</p>
