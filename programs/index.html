      <p class="title"><i>The School of Machines is a playground, bootcamp, community center, and lucid dream in equal parts. The mix of giving students, brilliant instructors with giant hearts, and visionary and thoughtful leadership made this exactly the art/tech education experience I've been trying to find for a long time.</i></p>

      <p class="title"><i>As a visual communication undergrad, I'm constantly exposed to working with print and amongst designers who advocate the idea that #printisnotdead. I am interested in merging the practices of visual communication and new media, and was very happy to find the School of MA, as it offers a unique and perfect place for me play with tech and art, and a starting point for me to branch out on skills that can help me to achieve my artistic goals. </i></p>

      <p class="title"><i>One of the things that I appreciated most was the utterly liberating atmosphere. Talking about ideas, associations, thoughts, sometimes related, sometimes unrelated to the projects, throughout the entire course was so special and created such a positive and fun environment! </i></p>

      <p class="title"><i>It was only after doing the school of MA that I saw how far from ‘now’ my undergraduate in product design was. As an independent school it seemed uncensored in its ability to offer a plethora of practical skills and thinking. For me, it was a shortcut to the future.</i>

      <p class="title"><i>I learnt so many things that cannot be summarized in a paragraph. But most importantly I learnt to appreciate art, how to use it as medium to change the way people think, inspire others and as a way to express yourself. Also how technology can assist us to express the artistic and creative views of a non-artist like me. </i></p>
