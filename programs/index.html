    <p class="text">Winners and Losers is an intensive four-week program led by creative artists and educators Alice Stewart, Mike Lazer-Walker, and returning favourites Kati Hyppä and Niklas Roy.


    <p class="text">Children grow up with a playful instinct. We learn to relate to, interact with and understand other humans through ‘games’. These games teach us notions of competition and cooperation that help acclimatize us to the adult world. Wrapped up in the idea of a game is frequently a notion of winning or losing. How does this conception trickle into our adult psyches and affect the social, economic and physical infrastructure we co-create?</p>

    <p class="text">Through world-building, and the creation of interactive and tactile experiences, we will create experimental games in the form of physical artifacts and installations. To do this, we will use both hardware and software to sense and respond to the environment around us as we set out to envision new societies and new modalities of play that might exist within them.</p>

<p class="text">Autonomous Generative Spirit is an intensive four-week program led by artists Gene Kogan and Andreas Refsgaard.</p> 

        <p class="text">In this program, we'll examine the ethical and sociocultural dimensions of machine learning, and discuss the coming issues which are sure to be preceded by the ever-increasing integration of these thinking machines into our daily lives.</p>

     <p class="text">Made In China is an intensive four-week program led by artists and creative technologists from London-based VVFA and Automato Farm based in Shanghai, China.</p>


     <p class="text">The aim of this program is to enable a hands-on creative exploration of digital fabrication and Internet-of-Things connected devices, while gaining deeper insight into China's cultural surroundings from an inside perspective. What are the implications of a society that can manufacture any new product on demand?  What can we learn from such an approach to society and to life?</p>



      <p class="text">Throughout the workshop we will explore critical and speculative design processes, enabling us to develop narratives, and tangible, accessible artefacts, experiences and environments with which to communicate and engage wider audiences with new possible futures.</p>


      <p class="text">Note: This program will be taking place in two cities. The first two weeks will be in Shanghai, China, while the third and fourth weeks of the program will take place in Shenzhen, China. This is in order to utilise Seeed Studios fabrication facilities located in Shenzhen.
