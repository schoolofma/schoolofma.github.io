        <p>How can we create meaningful experiences using technology to explore the very, very distant corners of the universe? How can speculative exploration of outer space provide new ways of understanding ourselves? In this four-week program, we'll journey to explore possible future scenarios, crafting artefacts destined to capture, manufacture, and re-enact human emotions in space.</p>

        <p>The aim for this program is to enable a hands-on approach to prototyping through a creative exploration of digital fabrication, electronics and sensors.</p>

          <p>This program is part of an on-going investigation and research project of Andrew Friend and Sitraka Rakotoniaina called Very, Very Far Away which is set to be realised in April 2016.</p>

          <p>Fabricating Empathy will emphasise use of digital fabrication and processes to examine how technologically mediated interactions can produce emotional and empathetic responses and how they could be repurposed to experience distant and even fictional territories.</p>

              <li class="list__item"><p> - Final exhibit in Berlin</p></li>
          </ul>


          <p>This program will culminate with a Berlin - London public livestream event where students will have the opportunity to showcase, demo, and discuss their projects, learnings and challenges met over the course of the program. Our partner team at SPACE Studios in London will imagine scenarios, contexts and worlds materialised through video and performances based on our work.  The event will be an evening conference, as part of the London Design Festival. In addition, there will be a final exhibit of your work in Berlin.</p>

      <p class="title">The School of Machines is a playground, bootcamp, community center, and lucid dream in equal parts. The mix of giving students, brilliant instructors with giant hearts, and visionary and thoughtful leadership made this exactly the art/tech education experience I've been trying to find for a long time.</p>

      <p class="title">Learning with a bunch of creative and skilled misfits couldn't have been more fun. The school took us from zero to sixty in one month, starting at the basics and ending with a public show of collaborative work. I understand the world of digital art in a deeper and practical way now. I'm proud to have been so immersed in Berlin culture with such a productive outcome.</p>

      <p class="title">I learnt so many things that cannot be summarized in a paragraph. But most importantly I learnt to appreciate art, how to use it as medium to change the way people think, inspire others and as a way to express yourself. Also how technology can assist us to express the artistic and creative views of a non-artist like me. </p>
