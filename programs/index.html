    <p class="text">This program offers a hands-on course in storymaking and storytelling.  Working as an experimental film unit,​ over the course of four weeks, w​e will speculate around the cultural and social impacts that the advances in virtual reality may have on society, forming narratives centred around personal visions of virtual worlds.</p>  

      <p class="text">We'll build a collection of experimental 360° films, each presenting different immersive experiences and stories within imagined virtual realities.</strong></p> </p>

<p class="text">All elements of our world are composed of vibrating particles that pass through time and space. By exploring the different ways in which we experience vibration, we'll be able to more effectively understand the web of relationships that together form our perception of the universe through our bodies, minds, and tools. In this program, we'll navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience with a special focus on sound and light.</p>

The course will focus on a critical exploration of the Internet as a transformative social environmental medium. The program will look deeply into the aesthetic narrative proposed by the net and will explore the way this configuration is codifying the social body in order to understand the real impact of communication technologies in our society and the physical world.</p>

  <p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to provide the students with theoretical background and practical (technical) skills (HTML5, CSS, JS) to creatively intervene in the aesthetic assembly of the medium in order to break, redefine and reappropriate it, an urgent exercise to build technological paradigms which may respond more coherently to our environmental and human conditions.</p>

    <p class="text">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the design of data-driven programs which autonomously demonstrate intelligent behavior in a variety of domains.</p>  

      <p class="text">It has gained rapid interest from the digital arts community, with the recent appearance of numerous artistic hacks of scientific research, such as Deepdream, Stylenet, NeuralTalk, and others. </p>

    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the field of machine learning as a subject for artistic practice and interdisciplinary research.</p>
