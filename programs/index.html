<p class="text">In this four-week intensive program guided by artists and speculative designers Sascha Pohflepp and Chris Woebken, you will be designing experiences through use of live-action role play techniques (LARPing), computer vision, machine learning, and speculative prototyping.</p>

<p class="text">We will provide a framework that revolves around a rapidly changing world increasingly bound to be populated by non-humans, both natural and artificialâ€”such as advanced AI systems. Making their perspectives  experienceable is going to be a key angle to designing for the new societies that will emerge.</p>


<p class="text">What you will learn: An overview of future studies tools, crafting scenarios, collaborative work, narrative prototyping, simulation techniques, character and game design for live action roleplaying, basics of advanced machine learning/neural networks, digital fabrication, environment/set design, project critique, exhibition production and documentation. </p>
