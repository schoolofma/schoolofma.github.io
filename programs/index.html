    <p class="text">This program offers a hands-on course in storymaking and storytelling. Over four weeks we'll investigate the creative potential of virtual reality and 360° video, gain a foundation in expanded fiction filmmaking and use built environments, narrative development, and directed performance to explore the outer limits of our imaginations with a design fiction approach. </p>

<!--strong style="font-weight: bold;" >VIBRATION vi bra tion  /vʌɪˈbreɪʃ(ə)n/  (Oxford Dictionaries online):</strong>
An instance of vibrating
1.1 Physics An oscillation of the parts of a fluid or an elastic solid whose equilibrium has been disturbed or of an electromagnetic wave
2 (vibrations) informal A person’s emotional state, the atmosphere of a place, or the associations of an object, as communicated to and felt by others</p-->

<p class="text">All elements of our world are composed of vibrating particles that pass through time and space. By exploring the different ways in which we experience vibration, we'll be able to more effectively understand the web of relationships that together form our perception of the universe through our bodies, minds, and tools. In this program, we'll navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience with a special focus on sound and light.</p>

The course will focus on a critical exploration of the Internet as a transformative social environmental medium. The program will look deeply into the aesthetic narrative proposed by the net and will explore the way this configuration is codifying the social body in order to understand the real impact of communication technologies in our society and the physical world.</p>

  <p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to provide the students with theoretical background and practical(technical) skills to creatively intervene in the aesthetic assembly of the medium in order to break, redefine and reappropriate it, an urgent exercise to build technological paradigms which will respond more coherently to our environmental and human conditions.</p>


<p class="text">More information coming soon. </p>
