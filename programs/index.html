    <p class="text">This course will focus on critically exploring the internet and software for its social and political impact, while learning the technical tools to intervene in purposeful ways.  Instead of simply accepting and consuming the technologies presented to us, we'll critically investigate the intentions and effects of these technologies, and ways they can be harnessed or exploited for meaningful social change.</p>

<p class="text">All elements of our world are composed of vibrating particles that pass through time and space. By exploring the different ways in which we experience vibration, we'll be able to more effectively understand the web of relationships that together form our perception of the universe through our bodies, minds, and tools. In this program, we'll navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience with a special focus on sound and light.</p>
