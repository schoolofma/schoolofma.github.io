    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the basics of computer vision and image processing for creative projects. Computer Vision is an area of research centered on how algorithms can extract information from images. This was originally done using still images, later video and now includes 3D data from cameras with 3D sensors. </p>

<strong style="font-weight: bold;" >VIBRATION vi bra tion  /vʌɪˈbreɪʃ(ə)n/  (Oxford Dictionaries online):</strong>
An instance of vibrating
1.1 Physics An oscillation of the parts of a fluid or an elastic solid whose equilibrium has been disturbed or of an electromagnetic wave
2 (vibrations) informal A person’s emotional state, the atmosphere of a place, or the associations of an object, as communicated to and felt by others</p>

<p class="text">All elements of our world are composed of vibrating particles that pass through time and space. By exploring the different ways in which we experience vibration, we will be able to more effectively understand the web of relationships that together form the whole of our universe through our bodies, minds, and tools. </p>

  <p class="text">In this program we'll learn the fundamentals of how vibrations (energy) move through space by working with visual and experimental sound artists to navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience. We'll also work with theoretical physicists to understand the fundamentals of vibrations, and how they influence every element of the world we live in.</p>

    <p class="text">
The course will focus on a critical exploration of the Internet as a transformative social environmental medium. The program will look deeply into the aesthetic narrative proposed by the net and will explore the way this configuration is codifying the social body in order to understand the real impact of communication technologies in our society and the physical world.

The main purpose of the program is to provide the students with theoretical background and practical(technical) skills to creatively intervene in the aesthetic assembly of the medium in order to break, redefine and reappropriate it, an urgent exercise to build technological paradigms which will respond more coherently to our environmental and human conditions.</p>
