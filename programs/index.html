		<p>The School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe will be hosting not one, but two Summer programs in 2014!</p>

				<dt class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 actual-item actual-01"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}programs/july-2014-responsive-spaces/" class="link">30 June - 25 July • Responsive Spaces</a></dt>
				<dd class="description sub">
					<!-- Rachel, add small description of the program below -->
					<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or&nbsp;tell stories with code?</p>
					<p>This course will focus on&nbsp;creative coding and interactivity in&nbsp;the context of&nbsp;responsive spaces. The goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;explore the creative and expressive possibilities of&nbsp;new technologies and digital tools and&nbsp;sensors while gaining a&nbsp;foundation in&nbsp;creative coding (algorithmic animation, computer vision, audio analysis and synthesis, projection mapping, networks, and 3D&nbsp;graphics).</p>

				<dd class="description sub">
					<!-- Rachel, add small description of the program below -->
					<p>How can we&nbsp;create meaningful interactive experiences or&nbsp;tell stories by&nbsp;making things move? </p>
					<p>This course will focus on&nbsp;physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of&nbsp;new technologies, digital fabrication (3D printing, laser-cutting) and how they can work seemlessly together to&nbsp;help you express yourself artistically in&nbsp;both thoughtful and/or non-sensical ways.</p>

		<p> Classes will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, technologists and educators, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;abundant time for self-directed, hands-on learning. Students will also have opportunities to&nbsp;share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops. In&nbsp;addition, we'll organise weekly artist-talks/discussion groups for&nbsp;participants with invited guest speakers. And if&nbsp;you're really lucky, just for fun, we&nbsp;may do&nbsp;something that looks a&nbsp;lot like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir0vELNbvHU" target="_blank">this</a>!</p>
