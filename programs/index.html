 </p>
 
  
  <p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">5 - 30 August  Money</strong></p>


  <p class="text">This program is about money! Whether we have it or 
not, money rules the world, or so it seems. In recent 
years, technologies like crypotocurrency, bitcoin, and 
blockchain have come to the fore offering alternatives 
to the current system but we need to know more! 
What’s the history of economies and money, what are 
the current financial systems that plague us, how does 
money laundering and tax evasion work, how might we 
create new systems and alternatives that can help bring 
about justice and level the playing field?</p>

  <p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">5  - 30 August  Coding for Beginners</strong></p>
  <p class="text">How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories with code? This course will focus on creative coding, narrative, interactivity, and self. The goal is to explore the creative and expressive possibilities of technology, digital tools, and self-expression while gaining a foundation in how to code.</p>
  
  <p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">2 - 27 September  Evidence</strong>
  <p class="text">This program delves into the topic of citizen forensics. 
We’ll take a deeper look into projects that have 
stemmed from a new movement of citizens taking 
action in the name of justice and human rights. From 
Forensic Architecture and VFRAME to Bellingcat and 
Tactical Technology Collective, we’ll learn how to 
gather information, problem-solve with the latest 
tools, and use critical techniques for safely navigating 
and investigating the world as a means of bearing 
witness. </p>
  <p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">30 September - 25 October  Waiting Room Design</strong>
  <p class="text">To be alive is to be waiting for something. What are we 
waiting for and why are we waiting for it? With the 
onslaught of new technologies, we find ourselves 
waiting even more, often for experiences (AR, VR, 
etc.), the likes of which are often less than ten minute 
encounters. With these questions in mind, this 
program is about waiting and waiting room design 
from a practical and future perspective.  How can we 
begin to create meaningful designed experiences for 
waiting rooms? Let’s explore this together! </p>

      <p class="text">As computational technologies advance, bots are often mischaracterized as agents with ML, making it hard to distinguish between programmed devices and artificial intelligence. Together, we will learn about bots and Machine Learning (ML), understand their differences and explore ways in which ML can transform bots. By integrating these separate components into a common creation, we can repurpose these tools and harness their capabilities for creative expression and empowerment.</p>

      <p class="text">Physical computing is a subject area that brings hardware and software together, usually through the application of microcontrollers, to make interactive things using a combination of sensors and outputs. The course will focus on physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of emerging technologies, and how they can work seamlessly together to create unique prototypes, products and experiences. Complex fields such as electronics, engineering and computer science will be demystified and explored as creative tools of endless possibility!</p>

      <p class="text">Data is everywhere. From our physical environment to surveillance mechanisms by Facebook and Google, we interact with data increasingly on a daily basis often without knowing it. Large entities such as corporations, governments and high-end investors leverage it for profit and control. The reality is, data also has physical consequences in the real world, and representing it with materials instead of pixels can create a meaningful real-life experience for ourselves and others.</p>

</p>



      <p class="text">Compelling us all is an interest in creatively exploring vast landscapes in the physical world and of the mind while gaining an understanding of the potentials of augmented-, virtual-, and mixed reality through a myriad of critical, conceptual, and hands-on approaches.</p>

       <p class="text">Using technology to imagine unknown realities can inspire new ways of looking at the world. In designing new forms of interactive and tactile experiences, artistic creation and storytelling, what could we add or augment to our surroundings to develop new narratives about landscapes, be them physical, social, or mental, that permeate our lives?  What forms of play and togetherness might we be able to create and sustain? Could thoughtful discourse on landscapes and realities empower us to making impactful change?</p>

     <p class="text">Made In China is an intensive four-week program led by artists and creative technologists from London-based VVFA and Automato Farm based in Shanghai, China.</p>


     <p class="text">The aim of this program is to enable a hands-on creative exploration of digital fabrication and Internet-of-Things connected devices, while gaining deeper insight into China's cultural surroundings from an inside perspective. What are the implications of a society that can manufacture any new product on demand?  What can we learn from such an approach to society and to life?</p>



      <p class="text">Throughout the workshop we will explore critical and speculative design processes, enabling us to develop narratives, and tangible, accessible artefacts, experiences and environments with which to communicate and engage wider audiences with new possible futures.</p>


      <p class="text">Note: This program will be taking place in two cities. The first two weeks will be in Shanghai, China, while the third and fourth weeks of the program will take place in Shenzhen, China. This is in order to utilise Seeed fabrication facilities located in Shenzhen.
