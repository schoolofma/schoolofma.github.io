    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the basics of computer vision and image processing for creative projects. Computer Vision is an area of research centered on how algorithms can extract information from images. This was originally done using still images, later video and now includes 3D data from cameras with 3D sensors. </p>

      <p class="text">Computer vision has found application in many areas: the military, video games,  police surveillance, robotics, etc. For artists and designers, computer vision can bring interactivity to works allowing reaction to body movement and motion, and allowing for the creation of new forms of imagery.</p> 

        <p class="text">Through the exploration of these technologies for creative purposes we’ll have the opportunity to see how these algorithms may or may not be used for privacy and surveillance and what problems it might pose to use them within different contexts. In a time when access to cameras and sharing of imagery is commonplace, the possibility of analyzing or manipulating images allows for new forms of commentary and creativity.</p>

    <p class="text">This course will be taught using Openframeworks.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward anyone involved in creative projects (designers, makers, artists, musicians, performers etc.) that want to begin incorporating computer vision into their work or practice. The course approaches computer vision from an introductory level, however a basic knowledge of programming (in any language/platform) is needed.</p>

<h4 class="title">Why should you care?</h4>

<p class="text">From tracking body movements to face detection and pixel manipulation, computer vision is a rich area that opens up many new possibilities. Low cost cameras and open source platforms now make this field much more accessible allowing us to introduce powerful algorithmic approaches to our creative endeavors. These kind of technologies are also pervasive in our daily lives and understanding their inner workings will allow us to take a critical stance on what they mean and how they influence society.</p>

    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the field of machine learning as a subject for artistic practice and interdisciplinary research. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the design of data-driven programs which autonomously demonstrate intelligent behavior in a variety of domains. </p>

    <p class="text">Machine learning is the backbone that powers self-driving cars, content recommendation in social media, face identification in digital forensics, and countless other high-level tasks. It has gained rapid interest from the digital arts community, with the recent appearance of numerous artistic hacks of scientific research, such as Deepdream, Stylenet, NeuralTalk, and others.</p>

<p class="text">Students will gain a practical and conceptual understanding of machine learning methods through the lens of creative subversion. Simple and deep neural networks will be introduced, analyzed, and applied within various artistic contexts. </p>

<p class="text">We will program self-adapting musical instruments (using Wekinator), generative poems, and machine-hallucinated visual and sound art, mediated by intelligent algorithms. We will examine the ethical and sociocultural dimensions of machine learning, and discuss the coming issues which are sure to be preceded by the ever-increasing integration of these thinking machines into our daily lives.</p>

<h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This course is aimed at people working in creative disciplines who wish to learn about machine intelligence and how to apply it in their own fields. It is *not* aimed at scientists or engineers who are seeking a rigorous technical course on machine learning -- plenty of such classes already exist. Instead, no specialized knowledge of mathematics or computer science is assumed or expected of students, and we will build up our understanding of the subject from elementary building blocks, imagination, analogy, and metaphor. This course is more practical than it is theoretical; we are interested less in proving theorems and equations, and more into hacking existing tools for making machines that do interesting things. </p>

<p class="text">People of diverse backgrounds and interests will all find something to take away from this class. If you are a journalist interested in the socioeconomic ramifications of increased automation, a musician wanting to manipulate your instruments with data streams, a designer wishing to imbue your craft with machine artifacts, or you’re just plain old fascinated by the age-old philosophical dilemma of cognition, this class is for you.
</p>

<h4 class="title">Why should you care?</h4>

<p class="text">Machine learning systems are all around us. When you deposit a check, scan your fingerprint, or post a picture on social media, autonomous algorithms are deployed on the spot to sift through and make sense of your constant interactions with our technology. Machine learning silently underpins the fabric of our digital infrastructure, discriminating spam e-mail and banking fraud, making light-speed transactions in the global financial market, recommending music and films for customers to buy, deciding what search results are relevant to your queries, and countless more of the daily interactions with electronic media that we take for granted. </p>

<p class="text">Creative re-appropriation of these techniques is necessary to refocus on machine learning's influence on those things which we care about. Artistic metaphors help clarify that which is otherwise shrouded by layers of academic jargon, making these highly specialized subjects more accessible to everyday people. Taking such an approach, we can repurpose these academic tools and harness their capabilities for creative expression and empowerment.

    <p class="text">This course offers a hands-on, intensive study of story-making and storytelling approaching the theme of virtual reality as a means to transport imagination into fictional narratives and environments. </p>

 <p class="text">In collaboration with an eclectic mix of guest practitioners we will address how different mediums and methodologies can enable us to move into the virtual and to invest in characters, spaces and stories. The emphasis will be on creating immersion - in both a visual and physical sense - through the design and making of new forms of escaping one reality and entering another. </p>

 <p class="text">Participants will build physical and digital scenes to create experiences which transform the studios and streets of Berlin into playful yet compelling elsewheres. </p>

 <p class="text">From drafting initial concepts, through to prototyping, and producing experiential performances, the program will provide an environment to explore the power of fiction as a medium to both enrich and disseminate ideas. Our motivation will be to look beyond the forefront technology enabling a virtual experience and to consider the wider cinematic, psychological and cultural issues of immersive virtuality.</p>

  <p class="text">We will learn to navigate the VVVV platform to create animations, data visualizations, sound maps, etc. We will also learn the fundamentals of how vibrations (energy) move through our bodies. We will work with visual and experimental sound artists to navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience, and we will work with theoretical physicists to understand the fundamentals of vibrations, and how they influence every element of the world we live in.</p>

The course will focus on a critical exploration of the Internet as a transformative social environmental medium. The program will look deeply into the aesthetic narrative proposed by the net and will explore the way this configuration is codifying the social body in order to understand the real impact of communication technologies in our society and the physical world.

The main purpose of the program is to provide the students with theoretical background and practical(technical) skills to creatively intervene in the aesthetic assembly of the medium in order to break, redefine and reappropriate it, an urgent exercise to build technological paradigms which will respond more coherently to our environmental and human conditions.</p>
