    <p class="text"><strong>What is reality? How can a deeper grasp of what is real inform how we craft experiences in augmented and virtual worlds? And how can we use AR to make the invisible visible - bringing to light the hidden narratives around us?</strong></p>

    <p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;"> Why are games designed in competitive ways? How is the winner vs. loser mentality affecting us as individuals and as a society? How can we express who we are and what we envision for the future with experimental games?</strong></p>

    <p class="text">Winners and Losers is an intensive four-week program led by creative artists and educators Alice Stewart, Mike Lazer-Walker, and returning favourites Kati Hyppä and Niklas Roy.


    <p class="text">As children, we grow up playing competitive games where the goal is to win, which means therefore that someone will inevitably lose. How does this trickle into our adult psyche’s and affect how we interact with others as we get older?</p>

    <p class="text">Through performance, world-building, and the creation of interactive and tactile experiences, we will create physical systems, in form of experimental games, that use both hardware and software to sense and respond to the analog world around us as we set out to envision new societies and new modalities of play that might exist within them.</p>

<p class="text">Autonomous Generative Spirit is an intensive four-week program led by artists Gene Kogan and Andreas Refsgaard.</p> 

        <p class="text">In this program, we'll examine the ethical and sociocultural dimensions of machine learning, and discuss the coming issues which are sure to be preceded by the ever-increasing integration of these thinking machines into our daily lives.</p>
