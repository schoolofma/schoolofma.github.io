    <p class="text">This course will focus on a critical exploration of the Internet as a transformative social medium with a strong focus on hands-on learning. The program will look deeply into the aesthetic narrative proposed by the net in order to understand the real impact of communication technologies in our society and the physical world.</p>

<p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to provide students with theoretical background and technical skills to creatively intervene in the aesthetic assembly of web interfaces in order to break, redefine and reappropriate them - an urgent exercise to build technological paradigms which can more meaningfully respond to our current environmental and human conditions.</p>

<p class="text">All elements of our world are composed of vibrating particles that pass through time and space. By exploring the different ways in which we experience vibration, we'll be able to more effectively understand the web of relationships that together form our perception of the universe through our bodies, minds, and tools. In this program, we'll navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience with a special focus on sound and light.</p>
