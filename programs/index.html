      <p class="text">Join the School of Machines in Berlin this June for a four-week pop-up co-working/co-creation opportunity. This is a unique chance to work, play and collaborate with like-minded creatives and artists in the heart of Berlin's creative technology community. You will also have full access to our equipment and facilities.</p>

      <p class="text">Along with an awesome location to work, you'll also have the option to use the Studio and Gallery for organising your own workshops and events. Have an idea for a short-course? Need help with planning and execution of your event idea? We'll do what we can to enable you to bring your idea to life!</p>

      <p class="text">Examining social relations by reframing our environments (social, physical or geopolitical) as ecosystems. Just as microbiomes are responsible for many of the processes and behaviors considered intrinsic to their hosts, we are all embedded in social systems, enabled and constrained by a tangle of relationships and interdependencies.</p>
      <p class="text">The goal of this program is to explore VR as a creative platform to address social issues, imagine new forms of social engagement, and create social experiences. </p>

      <p class="text">Augmented Ear Reality is a program led by sound artist Antoine Bertin and visual artist Helene Combal-Weiss. They meet in the design practice of sensorial experiences. Their hybrid creations merge auditory and tactile senses in the completion of objects, installation and participative experiments.</p>
      <p class="text">Leading an exploration of materials, shapes, human body, binaural recordings, interactive audio, and listening practices, participants are taken on a journey to reveal new and unexpected sensations.</p>

      <p class="text">Throughout life, we’re often called upon to reimagine a better world or a different kind of future yet we’re given very few methods, models, or tools for doing so in constructive ways. </p>

<p class="text">This course will use live-action role playing (LARPing) techniques, transforming them into prototyping tools for artists and designers that are as performative as they are productive, catering to a wide range of interests.</p>

<p class="text">We will learn how to conceive and actualize future scenarios through a looped process of simulation and speculative prototyping, turning them into valuable tools that will allow us to investigate, experiment, and develop provocative ideas for engaging complex social, ecological, technological and ethical issues. </p>
