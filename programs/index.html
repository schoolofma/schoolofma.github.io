					<p>How can we create meaningful experiences using technology to express who we are and where we came from? This course will focus on Empathy and Culture in the context of art and technology. While learning digital fabrication techniques, designing mechanisms and  kinetic sculptures as a way to animate the invisible forces that shape our human behaviour, we’ll simultaneously explore Empathy as a necessary tool to strengthen human connection and enhance our experiences of life.</p>
					<p>The goal of the program is to explore in-depth the creative and expressive possibilities of digital fabrication (3D printers, CNC) and kinetic objects while delving into speculative and critical design. In addition, we’ll also have an opportunity to explore Oculus Rift and ways in which it helps us to extend our empathic capabilities outside ourselves and into public spaces.</p> <p>Instructors and participants will work together towards the production of individual and group projects and will have access to the equipment needed to create functioning kinetic installations. You're going to have an amazing time delving into machinery, electronics and code and experimenting with your hands and even your heart. Our past students <a href="http://schoolofma.org/about/" target="_blank">loved our programs</a>, no doubt you will, too! <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1D8ejtJC9BvtFPRzMIaTwq8eIYSUgL4ZfcrQvIcEsTmc/viewform" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Join us!</a></p>

			<h3>Plan</h3>
			<p>Throughout the program, there will be time for interesting exercises, collaborations, and even outside excursions — it will be summertime in Berlin, after all!  Not only that, we’ll also have guest speakers and artist talks alongside the base classes and workshops.</p>
			<p>The program begins at 10am every morning with an Core Programming course which runs a few hours long, followed by a lunch break, collaborative worktime and an afternoon lab session. Some days there will be more on the schedule particularly the first two weeks. Four weeks will go by quickly and we want to provide as much content and opportunities for creative hands-on learning as possible!</p>
			<p>We will be doing group check-ins so that students can voice where they would like more help and focus. Fridays will be a bit more experimental with guest lectures and other outside activities. We will provide as many opportunities for engagement as possible, with creative exercises and group activities. We believe in learning by doing and in having fun!</p>
			<h4>1st week</h4>
			<p>Getting familiar with your tools: the basics of programming. It’s also the time for everyone to get to know each other and to explore ideas and concepts surrounding art, technology, interactivity, and storytelling.  Along with core coding classes, we’ll examine and explore questions about the purpose of technology in art.  What kinds of conceptual expression are made possible through programming? How can interactivity be used to tell your stories? Main instructors during this first week will be <a href="#arturo-castro">Arturo Castro</a>, <a href="#abe-pazos">Abe Pazos</a>, <a href="#anrick-bregman">Anrick Bregman</a>, <a href="#astrid-bin">S. Astrid Bin</a>, and <a href="#raphaël-de-courville">Raphaël de Courville</a>.</p>
			<h4>2nd & 3rd weeks</h4>
			<p>Main focus will be on getting more hands-on with tools like Processing and openFrameworks.  By week three, we'll be delving more into Interactive aspects of programming and animation. We’ll also explore using sensors to detect the world around you, and delve into sound synthesis with frameworks like Max/MSP, Pure Data, and SuperCollider. Main instructors during this time will be Abe Pazos, Arturo Castro, and Chris Sugrue.  We’ll also be joined for a hands-on workshop by heart chamber orchestra mastermind <a href="#peter-pure-votava">Peter Votava</a>!</p>
		
			<h4>4th week</h4>
			<p>The final week is dedicated to advanced interaction and further development of projects, both collaborative and individual, to be showcased at the final event.</p>

								<p class="text">beanotherlab is an international, interdisciplinary collective dedicated
												to investigate embodied and telepresence experiments. We believe that
												the understanding of the “self” is related to the understanding of the
												“Other” and that more than individuals, we are part of a broader system
												called humanity. Under this perspective, we search for innovative
												possibilities on the concepts of embodied interaction, extended body and
												extended mind by mixing low-budget digital technology with social
												relations, Web and neuroscience methodologies.</p>

								<p class="text">We develop Creative Commons tools based on Open Knowledge and are
												collaborating with experimental psychologists and neuroscientists to
												develop usage procedures to ‘the machine’ as a low-budget rehabilitation
												system, and also as an immersive role playing system.</p>

								<p class="text">Born in Madagascar and raised in Paris, Sitraka currently lives and works in London. He is an Artist and Designer whose body of works ranges from fictional science experiments to speculative objects and devices. His work explores our relation to science and technology, encompassing cultural and social implications, as well as the beliefs and values intrinsic to their development. With a focus on the possibility of transforming individual sensory experiences, Sitraka often uses the human body as vehicle to trigger people’s imagination. </p>

								<p class="text">He ‘crafts’ narratives through the conception and fabrication of objects and uses their ‘aesthetic’ qualities and theatricality as the foundations enabling a physical form of storytelling. Sitraka studied Industrial Design and Graphic Design/Multimedia in Paris, and graduated from the Design Interactions course at the Royal College of Art. He has worked as an independent Interaction Designer since 2006 and is currently represented by Nexus Interactive Arts as a Director on their roster. </p>

								<p class="text">His work has been shown internationally including venues such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, Venice Architecture Biennale, Saint-Etienne design Biennial, the Art Center College of Design. And recognised through awards and publications including D&AD, we-make-money-not-art, Axis Magazine, See Yourself Sensing by Madeline Schwartzman, Design and Violence by the MoMA, etc.</p>

										<p class="text">Andrew Friend  is an artist and designer who’s work explores experience, and the relationship between people, landscape, and their desires. He is interested in the extraordinary, fantastic and desirable (or indeed undesirable) experiences and outcomes that may result from these interactions. His work spans a range of media, through narrative and drawings to large scale physical objects designed to promote, facilitate, and question these experiences, examining relationships between the known and unknown, the real and imagined in the individual quest to harness the sublime.

								<h5 class="name">Pussykrew <span class="sub web">/&nbsp;<a href="http://niochnioszki.net/xxx/index.php/news/" target="_blank">niochnioszki.net/xxx/</a></span></h5>
								<p class="text">Ewelina Aleksandrowicz (Tikul) and Andrzej Wojtas (mi$ Gogo), also known collectively as Pussykrew, are collaboratively working within the area of 'new' media. 
								Their interdisciplinary practices range from multimedia installations, 3D landscapes, video short forms and audio-visual performance - to DIY electronics and object design.</p>
								<p class="text">Pussykrew is constantly trying to challenge the viewer, through an exploration of post-human identity / bodily queerness / urban landscapes and their transformations / multi-sensorial physical affection. By dealing with the issues of materiality, they're creating new synthetic-organic forms, that are constantly in the process of mutation. </p>
								<p class="text">Their works were presented internationally at various Digital Arts Festivals and art spaces across US, Australia, Finland, Germany, UK, Ireland, France, Sweden, Austria, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Iran, China, Taiwan, Poland .. ( i.a. Saatchi Gallery London / Carrousel du Louvre Paris / Espace Pierre Cardin Paris / Oberhausen Kurzfilmtage / European Media Art Festival / WRO Biennale / Pixelache / Screengrab New Media Award Australia )
								They've been recently awarded with the Artist of the Year Award at the 3D Print Show London.</p>
