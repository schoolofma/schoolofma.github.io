The magic is in how the technology stimulates our curiosity and invites us to rethink possibilities and envision new worlds.</p>
      <p class="text">This program will focus on that magic— artistic asset production- for use in our future imaginaries and virtual spaces.</p>

<p class="text">This course will use live-action role playing (LARPing) techniques, transforming them into prototyping tools for artists and designers that are as performative as they are productive, catering to a wide range of interests.</p>

<p class="text">We will learn how to conceive and actualize future scenarios through a looped process of simulation and speculative prototyping, turning them into valuable tools that will allow us to investigate, experiment, and develop provocative ideas for engaging complex social, ecological, technological and ethical issues. </p>

<p class="text">Through participation in this program, attendees will have a unique opportunity to investigate topics related to creative artificial intelligence and machine learning for artists with a group of like-minded peers and experienced mentors for up to four-weeks, this April 2017.</p>

<p class="text">Individually, and as a group, we'll spend time examining the ethical and sociocultural dimensions of machine learning, while discussing issues of significance surrounding the ever-increasing integration of these thinking machines into our daily lives. We'll also explore the implications of perception and the notion and possibilities of future feeling machines.</p>

<p class="text">This program will coincide with Belgrade's beloved annual Resonate festival dedicated to creative technology, audiovisual and music performance.</p>

<p class="text">All elements of our world are composed of vibrating particles that pass through time and space. By exploring the different ways in which we experience vibration, we'll be able to more effectively understand the web of relationships that together form our perception of the universe through our bodies, minds, and tools. In this program, we'll navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience with a special focus on sound and light.</p>
