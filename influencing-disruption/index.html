    <p class="text">The course will focus on a critical exploration of the Internet as a transformative social environmental medium. The program will look deeply into the aesthetic narrative proposed by the net and will explore the way this configuration is codifying the social body in order to understand the real impact of communication technologies in our society and the physical world.</p>

<p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to provide the students with theoretical background and practical(technical) skills to creatively intervene in the aesthetic assembly of the medium in order to break, redefine and reappropriate it, an urgent exercise to build technological paradigms which will respond more coherently to our environmental and human conditions.</p>

<h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>
<p class="text">Seduction or dictatorship? How many
times a day do we accept, without negotiating, the everyday demands
inscribed in the design of user interfaces? What rhetoric hides the
apparent neutrality of its design? What values represent? What about the
data we generate through an interface? Which impact does its materiality
have in the physical world? How does it transform and encode the social
and intimate sphere?</p>

<p class="text">This programme seeks to critically reveal, analyze and connect the
complex network of agents that converge on the configuration of the
Graphic User Interface (GUI). During a 4 week-long programme we will
creatively reveal, deconstruct and re-articulate the material and
immaterial elements that construct the GUI in order to reflect on its
role and influence within the social, political, economic, cultural and
emotional spheres of the networked society. </p>

<p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to provide the students with theoretical background and technical skills to explore, develop and test disruptive
methodologies to stimulate and re-appropriate subjectivity, an essential
process in the generation of critical thought about the true nature of
technology, and in the imagination of alternative techno-paradigms which
may coherently respond to our environmental and human conditions.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>
<p class="text">This program is for artists, designers, writers, makers, coders, journalists
and researchers interested in understanding, exploring and intervening
(disrupting) what's behind the interface and acknowledging the social,
political, economical, cultural and emotional effects of the Interface
in the networked society.</p>
