How can we redefine and take back our digital spaces to encode our own social and intimate spheres to create social change?</strong></p>

    <p class="text">This course will focus on critically exploring the internet and software for its social and political impact, while learning the technical tools to intervene in purposeful ways.  Instead of simply accepting and consuming the technologies presented to us, we'll critically investigate the intentions and effects of these technologies, and ways they can be harnessed or exploited for meaningful social change.

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
    </h4>
    <p class="text">This program is for artists, designers, writers, makers, coders, journalists
      and researchers interested in understanding, exploring and disrupting what's behind web interfaces.  We will also investigate the underlying intentions of user interfaces, and how the UI designs demonstrate the latent political, socioeconomic, emotional, and cultural [opinions / tendencies / desires] of their designers.</p>

No longer is the focus on how many friends you have or on how much they like your status, but on who they are and what they said. (Ben Grosser)</p>

      <p class="text">During this four-week long program, we will creatively reveal, deconstruct and re-articulate the role and influence of the internet and software on society by looking at examples of subversive/disruptive web practices and net hacktivism. </p>



      <p class="text">We will consider ways of using the web as a medium for activism, social change, political commentary while learning the technical tools required to creatively intervene - an urgent exercise to build technological paradigms which can more meaningfully respond to our current environmental and human conditions.</p>
