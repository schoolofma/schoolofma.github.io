What about the data we generate through an interface? What impact does its materiality have in the physical world? How does it transform and encode our social and intimate spheres?</strong></p>

    <p class="text">The course will focus on a critical exploration of the Internet as a transformative social environmental medium. The program will look deeply into the aesthetic narrative proposed by the net in order to understand the real impact of communication technologies in our society and the physical world.</p>


    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/joana001.jpg" class="pic">

<p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to provide students with theoretical background and technical skills to creatively intervene in the aesthetic assembly of the medium in order to break, redefine and reappropriate it - an urgent exercise to build technological paradigms which will respond more coherently to our environmental and human conditions.</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/tracing-you-gif-master-shorter2-530-530x298.gif" class="pic">

<p class="text">This programme seeks to critically reveal, analyze and connect the
complex network of agents that converge on the configuration of the
Graphic User Interface (GUI). During a 4 week-long programme we will
creatively reveal, deconstruct and re-articulate the material and
immaterial elements that construct the GUI in order to reflect on its
role and influence within the social, political, economic, cultural and
emotional spheres of the networked society. </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/numbers_snowangels.gif" class="pic">

<p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to provide the students with theoretical background and technical skills to explore, develop and test disruptive
methodologies in the generation of critical thought about the true nature of
technology, and in the imagination of alternative techno-paradigms which
may coherently respond to our environmental and human conditions.</p>
