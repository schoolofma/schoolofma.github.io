 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of sculpture and fabrication techniques for purposes of reimagining headsets for virtual reality experiences and critical discourse.</p>

    <p class="text">Computer Vision is an area of research centered on how algorithms can extract information from images. This was originally done using still images, later video and now includes 3D data from cameras with 3D sensors. </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/leo006.jpg" class="pic">


      <p class="text">Computer vision has found application in many areas: the military, video games,  police surveillance, robotics, etc. For artists and designers, computer vision can bring interactivity to works allowing reaction to body movement and motion, and allowing for the creation of new forms of imagery.</p> 

      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/leo005.jpg" class="pic">

        <p class="text">Through the exploration of these technologies for creative purposes we’ll have the opportunity to see how these algorithms may be used for privacy and surveillance and what problems it might pose to use them within different contexts. In a time when access to cameras and sharing of imagery is commonplace, the possibility of analyzing or manipulating images allows for new forms of commentary and creativity.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward anyone interested in fabrication techniques to make and build their own unique objects. (designers, makers, artists, musicians, performers etc.) that want to begin incorporating computer vision into their work or practice. The course approaches computer vision from an introductory level, however a basic knowledge of programming (in any language/platform) is encouraged.</p>

                    <p class="text">Andrew Friend is an artist and designer who’s work explores experience, and the relationship between people, landscape, and their desires. He is interested in the extraordinary, fantastic and desirable (or indeed undesirable) experiences and outcomes that may result from these interactions. His work spans a range of media, through narrative and drawings to large scale physical objects designed to promote, facilitate, and question these experiences, examining relationships between the known and unknown, the real and imagined in the individual quest to harness the sublime.

            <p class="text">Leo Castaneda (born Cali, Colombia 1988) is an artist based in Miami and New York working in the intersection of painting and virtual reality. He uses these among other mediums such as drawing, interactive sculpture, and animation to analyze and deconstruct the structures of video-games, and how these structures relate to those of Art and the world at large. </p>   

            <p class="text">Castaneda received his BFA from Cooper Union in 2010, and in 2014 received his MFA at Hunter College. In 2014 Castaneda received a scholarship from the Cisneros Foundation to attend SOMA Summer in Mexico City.  He has also attended a semester abroad in Universitat de Barcelona, Spain, and studied in New World School of the Arts in Miami.  </p>
