<p class="text">
  Every now and again, a "new" VR headset is introduced out into the world. For the most part, give or take a bevelled edge here or there, each one looks not too unlike all the previous ones that came before.</p>

 <p class="text">While, of course, what counts are the innards of these headsets and the software underneath the hood, what we inevitably *see* around us is a sea of same, or as artist/environmental engineer, Tega Brain, so poetically proclaimed, <a href="http://somethingsomethingendofmen.tumblr.com/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Something Something End of Men</a>. </p>


  <p class="text">In this four-week program we'll set out to question the validity that corporations get to define what our future societies will look like, in a creative and playful attempt to see what we might discover on the other side.

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of sculpture, fabrication, and design fiction methodologies in order to reimagine headsets and the role of sculpture within virtual reality experiences for purposes of entertainment and critical discourse.</p> 



      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/leo005.jpg" class="pic">


      <p class="text">Using a hands-on approach, we will investigate the creative and expressive possibilities and aesthetics of virtual and mixed realities.</p> 

      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/leo004.jpg" class="pic">

        <p class="text">Inhabiting a fictional narrative, students will dream up inventive ideas for new viewing experiences through sculpture and VR headset design and with the aid of instructors and other professionals, learn the proper tools and processes needed to create and communicate their own visions of the future to an outside world.</p>


        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/leo003.jpg" class="pic">


        <p class="text">Starting with basic prototyping through to advanced fabrication techniques, we will work through the entire process of design from initial narrative and conception through rough prototyping. At program's end, we will present a fully documented exhibition of our final objects.</p>
  

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward artists, architects, designers, and anyone interested in traditional sculpture and fabrication techniques to make and build their own unique objects for viewing virtual and mixed reality experiences. </p>

            <p class="text">Leo Castaneda (born Cali, Colombia 1988) is an artist based in Miami and New York working in the intersection of painting and virtual reality. He uses these among other mediums such as drawing, interactive sculpture, and animation to analyze and deconstruct the structures of video-games, and how these structures relate to those of Art and the world at large. </p>   

            <p class="text">Castaneda received his BFA from Cooper Union in 2010, and in 2014 received his MFA at Hunter College. In 2014 Castaneda received a scholarship from the Cisneros Foundation to attend SOMA Summer in Mexico City.  He has also attended a semester abroad in Universitat de Barcelona, Spain, and studied in New World School of the Arts in Miami.  </p>
