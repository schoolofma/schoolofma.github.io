    <p>In our four-week program "Coming Soon", using a hands-on approach, we will investigate the creative and expressive possibilities of Internet of Things technologies, electronics and sensors, while gaining a foundation in digital fabrication and design fiction methodologies. </p>

    <p>Inhabiting a fictional narrative, students will dream up inventive ideas for new smart objects and with the aid of our instructors and other professionals, learn the proper tools and processes needed to create and communicate their own vision of the future. </p>

    <p>Starting with basic prototyping through to advanced fabrication techniques, making use of the latest digital fabrication tools within the Officine Arduino community facilities, we will work through the entire process of design from initial narrative and conception through rough prototyping. At program's end, we will present a fully documented performance and exhibition of our final objects in Casa Jasmina, the connected home of the future conceived by science fiction writer Bruce Sterling and Massimo Banzi, co-founder of the Arduino project.</p>

    <p>The infiltration of smart devices into our lives is coming soon. Currently, corporations and even governments are investing billions to fund research and manufacture up-and-coming networked objects designed to "make our lives easier". But what are the implications of this?</p> 

    <p>Throughout the program, we will collectively construct the mythologies and belief systems we inhabit, as a means to speculate around the possible impacts contemporary exploration may have on future society. </p>

                <p class="text">Born in Madagascar and raised in Paris, Sitraka Rakotoniaina currently lives and works in London. He is an Artist and Designer whose body of works ranges from fictional science experiments to speculative objects and devices. His work explores our relation to science and technology, encompassing cultural and social implications, as well as the beliefs and values intrinsic to their development. With a focus on the possibility of transforming individual sensory experiences, Sitraka often uses the human body as vehicle to trigger people’s imagination. </p>

                <p class="text">He ‘crafts’ narratives through the conception and fabrication of objects and uses their ‘aesthetic’ qualities and theatricality as the foundations enabling a physical form of storytelling. Sitraka studied Industrial Design and Graphic Design/Multimedia in Paris, and graduated from the Design Interactions course at the Royal College of Art. He has worked as an independent Interaction Designer since 2006 and is currently represented by Nexus Interactive Arts as a Director on their roster. </p>

                <p class="text">His work has been shown internationally including venues such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, Venice Architecture Biennale, Saint-Etienne design Biennial, the Art Center College of Design. And recognised through awards and publications including D&AD, we-make-money-not-art, Axis Magazine, See Yourself Sensing by Madeline Schwartzman, Design and Violence by the MoMA, etc.</p>

                    <p class="text">Andrew Friend is an artist and designer who’s work explores experience, and the relationship between people, landscape, and their desires. He is interested in the extraordinary, fantastic and desirable (or indeed undesirable) experiences and outcomes that may result from these interactions. His work spans a range of media, through narrative and drawings to large scale physical objects designed to promote, facilitate, and question these experiences, examining relationships between the known and unknown, the real and imagined in the individual quest to harness the sublime.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">His work has been exhibited and published internationally at institutions including The National Museum of China, Beijing,  Welcome Collection, London,  & Art Centre, Los Angeles, USA, in 2015 he was awarded the Arte Laguna Prize, (Land art division), Venice Italy. Andrew is currently studio leader and associate lecturer in the department of Spatial Practices, Central St Martins, University of the Arts London.

                    <p class="text">Iohanna Nicenboim is a Berlin based designer and researcher, focused on creating poetical interactions with technology. Inspired by complex socio-technical systems and scientific imaginary, she creates speculative futures and alternative presents in different scales and formats: from generative food installations to narrative connected devices. Her practice overlaps design, science and data, showing a critical and provocative approach towards technology and the way it relates to society.</p> 

                    <p class="text">Her recent work is concerned with the social and ethical aspects of the Internet of Things, investigating what our role as humans in the connected home would be, suggesting we may become the objects of the systems we have created. In this way, Iohanna encourages a critical reflection on the models of the Internet and the use of data in our daily lives. </p> 

                    <p class="text">She is currently a teacher at Node Center, part of the organisation team of Retune Conference, and a reviewer for TEI16: Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction conference. Aside from various workshops and residencies, her work has been featured in international festivals, such as FutureEverything, and books like DataFlow.
