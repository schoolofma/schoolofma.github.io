      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>

      <p class="text">Virtual Reality is a medium compelling us to explore artistic creation, storytelling, and interactivity. The goal of this program is to explore VR as a creative platform to address social issues, imagine new forms of social engagement and create social experiences.</p>

      <p class="text">The primary tool of this program will be Unity 3D. We will also incorporate 3D, 360 video, video-tracking and micro-controllers.  As we engage the potential of these new tools, we will also take a critical perspective discussing the shortcomings and challenges.</p>

      <p class="text">Examining social relations by reframing our environments (social, physical or geopolitical) as ecosystems. Just as microbiomes are responsible for many of the processes and behaviors considered intrinsic to their hosts, we are all embedded in social systems, enabled and constrained by a tangle of relationships and interdependencies.</p>


      <p class="text">Such reframing allows us to focus on narratives that offer new ways of understanding ourselves, other animals, plants, stones, habitats and ecosystems, and as super-communities made up of networked collectivity functioning as something more than the sum of its parts. </p>

      <p class="text">This summer, we attempt to go beyond that binary, inspiring a nuanced look at different styles of coexistence, at shifts in community variations and their influence, and to extend this framing to macro-scale communities and biomes. </p>

          <p class="text">Laura Juo-Hsin Chen is a creative technologist and doodler originally from Taipei, Taiwan. With a background in traditional 3D animation, Laura acquired a Master’s degree at the NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) in 2015. She recently completed a Research Residency at ITP, and lives in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

          <p class="text">Laura is interested in weird human interactions and their impact on the subconscious. For MASK, her Master’s Thesis, she made a series of customized virtual reality headsets. Each mask has its own VR experience and physical functions for the purpose of overcoming communication difficulties. Participants empower themselves by wearing different versions of MASK, as an approach to one of Laura’s abiding questions: how can one change a person’s perspective by changing their perception?</p>

          <p class="text">Laura uses open-source technologies and a low-tech approach to create lighthearted and publicly accessible experiences. Recently, she has exhibited her works at De Brakke Grond, Amsterdam, Museum of the Moving Image, Grand Central Terminal, and Time Squares in New York City, and has given workshops and talks at the Queens Museum, and the IDFA DocLab.</p>
