		<p>The School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe will be hosting not one, but two Summer programs!</p><p> Classes will be a mix of lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, technologists and educators, as well as abundant time for self-directed, hands-on learning. Students will also have opportunities to share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops. In addition, we'll organise weekly artist-talks/discussion groups for participants with invited guest speakers. And if you're really lucky, just for fun, we may do something that looks a lot like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir0vELNbvHU" title="Jazzercise">this</a>!</p>

			<h3 class="title">Responsive Spaces <span class="sub warning">/ July 2014</span></h3>
			
			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories with code? This course will focus on creative coding and interactivity in the context of responsive spaces. The goal is to explore the creative and expressive possibilities of new technologies and digital tools and sensors while gaining a foundation in creative coding (algorithmic animation, computer vision, audio analysis and synthesis, projection mapping, networks, and 3D graphics).</p>
			<p>We will work mainly with OpenFrameworks and Processing, but other platforms will also be incorporated such as Max/PureData and SuperCollider. Teachers and students will work together towards the production of individual or group projects and will have access to the equipment needed to create functioning responsive installations. Expect to play with code, be experimental and have fun!</p>

			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories by making things move?  This course will focus on physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of new technologies, digital fabrication (3D printing, laser-cutting) and how they can work seemlessly together to help you express yourself artistically in both thoughtful and/or non-sensical ways.</p>
			<p>Teachers and students will take a hands-on approach to working with basic electronic components, sensors and motors as well as with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, learning to use these tools to play and to create magical things that move! </p>
