      <p>The aim for this program is to enable a hands-on approach and creative exploration of digital fabrication, and the creation of Internet of Things connected devices.</p>

      <p>China Futurism will emphasise the learning and use of digital fabrication and processes to examine how technologically mediated interactions can produce emotional and empathetic responses and how they could be repurposed to enable us to experience distant futures.</p>


      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>

      <p class="text">In this workshop we will develop fictions, future potentials rooted in a solid reality, taking us on a journey from the possible, through the plausible, preferable (or not) and into the future.</p>
      
      <p class="text">We are interested in using design as an exploratory tool, in order to depict the possibilities associated with new and future technologies. Through an entanglement of narratives we will paint a picture of a tomorrow, imagining objects, artefacts and systems starting from the very small and peculiar and reaching towards a broader bigger picture. In doing so we will critique the cultural and social implications of these aspirations, whilst reflecting heavily on the present status quo.</p>

      <p class="text">Throughout the workshop we will explore critical and speculative design processes, and how by using these we can ultimately develop worked narratives, and tangible, accessible artefacts, experiences and environments communicating and engaging wider audiences with new possible futures.</p>

      


      <h4 class="title">Learning outcomes</h4>
      
      <p class="text">The students involved in this process will develop their understanding of current and foreseen technological implications, leading to an awareness that will encourage them to take a stance and contextualise their design proposals.</p>

      <p class="text">They will learn methods for addressing and engaging with new and emerging technologies to prototype relevant and thoughtful futures and gain a practical experience of a speculative design process, focussed on world building and narrative development from a design perspective.</p>

      <p class="text">Experience extracting and extrapolating pieces of these worlds, their communication and the dissemination of ideas through object and elemental development.</p>

      <h4 class="title">In this course, you will be introduced to</h4>

      <p class="text">
        - Prototyping as iterative design and development process</br>
        - Design, development and fabrication of physical mechanisms</br>
        - Integration of multiple materials and media to create interactive objects</br>
        - CAD design for fabrication: use of Rhino to develop 3D models suitable for manufacture with 3D printers, CNC machines, and laser-cutters</br>
        - Digital fabrication tooling, e.g. 3D printing moulds, jigs, etc.</br>
        - Basic programming using Arduino - motors, steppers, servos, sensors, LED strips, etc.</br>
        - Use and integration of traditional manufacturing processes alongside new technologies in creation of new objects/components.</br>
        - Experience with different materials, e.g. plastics, metals, rubbers, timber, etc.</br>
        - Presentation and communication of ideas to an international audience in China.</br>
              
      </p>

      <h4 class="title">Pt 01; World Creation</h4>

<p class="text">Using a speculative design process, we will conjure detailed timelines for alternative, or possible futures. Using a collaborative world building process we will utilise the collective experience of the group to investigate and detail a potential future (and the many aspects and intricacies that this may incorporate). Working in groups we will develop thorough narratives within this world and create audio recordings starting to tell the stories we uncover.</p>

<h4 class="title">Pt 02; Fabricating the Fiction – Reverse Archeology</h4>

<p class="text">Having developed the narratives of ‘a’ tomorrow during and following on from the first session, we will extract and design the iconic objects, artefacts or moments seen as pivotal, crucial and primordial to understand the history, customs, values, culture and technologies that are shaping this newly made world. These will culminate in the formation and documentation of a collective archive of objects and artefacts not yet invented, along with the audio narratives and context associated with them.</p>


<h4 class="title">Pt 03; Inhabiting the Fiction – Situational Response</h4>

<p class="text">Following on from part 1 we will invite participants to explore a series of specific locations and sites in order to create a live performative response to the location relating to the world context developed in the previous section.  Through this live response we can challenge and test assumptions and uncover new possible aspects of the original futures and indeed sightings for the investigation.  </p>



      <h4 class="title">Course Outline</h4>

                <p class="text">Born in Madagascar and raised in Paris, Sitraka currently lives and works in London. He is an Artist and Designer whose body of works ranges from fictional science experiments to speculative objects and devices. His work explores our relation to science and technology, encompassing cultural and social implications, as well as the beliefs and values intrinsic to their development. With a focus on the possibility of transforming individual sensory experiences, Sitraka often uses the human body as vehicle to trigger people’s imagination. </p>

                <p class="text">He ‘crafts’ narratives through the conception and fabrication of objects and uses their ‘aesthetic’ qualities and theatricality as the foundations enabling a physical form of storytelling. Sitraka studied Industrial Design and Graphic Design/Multimedia in Paris, and graduated from the Design Interactions course at the Royal College of Art. He has worked as an independent Interaction Designer since 2006 and is currently represented by Nexus Interactive Arts as a Director on their roster. </p>

                <p class="text">His work has been shown internationally including venues such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, Venice Architecture Biennale, Saint-Etienne design Biennial, the Art Center College of Design. And recognised through awards and publications including D&AD, we-make-money-not-art, Axis Magazine, See Yourself Sensing by Madeline Schwartzman, Design and Violence by the MoMA, etc.</p>

He is interested in the extraordinary, fantastic and desirable (or indeed undesirable) experiences and outcomes that may result from these interactions. His work spans a range of media, through narrative and drawings to large scale physical objects designed to promote, facilitate, and question these experiences, examining relationships between the known and unknown, the real and imagined in the individual quest to harness the sublime.

                <p class="text">In a future world of overpopulated, smog-filled cities and self-aware appliances, what will the everyday objects that frustrate and delight us—our gadgets—look like? Simone Rebaudengo, an Italian interaction designer based in Shanghai, isn’t just dreaming them up. He’s actually building the prototypes.</p>

                <p class="text">He has been constantly speculating about those futures at Automato and, for the past four years, at frog, where he worked with Fortune 500 clients and small startups in bridging the gap between design research, product innovation and big delivery projects across Europe, Asia and Australia.</p>

                <p class="text">His products and scenarios are believable enough to be real, but come from hypothetical and questionable futures. His research focuses on exploring the implications of living with networked and somewhat smart products that change, grow, and are intelligent enough to take their own decisions and show a point of view.</p>

                <p class="text">He’s been teaching and presenting at CIID, SUPSI, China Academy of Fine Arts, Tedx, IxDA, SolidCon, Thingscon and Dconstruct. His works have been published internationally in Wired, Fastcompany, The Atlantic and Designboom. He has won numerous industry awards including two 2014 IXDA Interaction Awards for “Addicted Products”, and a 2015-2016 Internet of Things Award for Best Design Fiction for his “Ethical Things” project.</p>

                <p class="text">Saurabh Datta is an Interaction designer and design technologist working for frog design by day and a cretaive technologist, critical media artist by night working for automato.farm. He had done his structural engineering and robotics from India and then his Masters in Interaction Design from Copenhagen. His interestes shifts between traditional Human Computer interaction modalities and philosophies, Glitch and disturbance studies, Critical arts and engineering, physicality and ethics of technology.</p>

                <p class="text">A large part of his work involves design process, scientific analysis sometimes and a philosophical stance but his articulations are not so often a closed product ended scenario. Rather they are a bit of reflection in process and act as models for abstraction, inspiration and resourcing. That way sometimes they are often perceived as artistic in nature. He tries not to be caught up in the usual trends or the definition of his subjects but constantly pursue for what might be plausible.</p>
