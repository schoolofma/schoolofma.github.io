<p class="text">
  Computer Vision is a responsive, interactive, and exciting tool for realising creative vision.
  From tracking body movements to face detection and pixel manipulation, computer vision is a rich area that opens up many new possibilities. Low cost cameras and open source platforms now make this field much more accessible allowing us to introduce powerful algorithmic approaches to our creative endeavors. </p>

  <p class="text">These kinds of technologies are also pervasive in our daily lives and understanding their inner workings will allow us to take a critical stance on what they mean and how they influence society.</p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of computer vision and image processing for creative projects and critical discourse.</p> 

    <p class="text">Computer Vision is an area of research centered on how algorithms can extract information from images. This was originally done using still images, later video and now includes 3D data from cameras with 3D sensors. </p>

      <p class="text">Computer vision has found application in many areas: the military, video games,  police surveillance, robotics, etc. For artists and designers, computer vision can bring interactivity to works allowing reaction to body movement and motion, and allowing for the creation of new forms of imagery.</p> 

        <p class="text">Through the exploration of these technologies for creative purposes we’ll have the opportunity to see how these algorithms may be used for privacy and surveillance and what problems it might pose to use them within different contexts. In a time when access to cameras and sharing of imagery is commonplace, the possibility of analyzing or manipulating images allows for new forms of commentary and creativity.</p>

    <p class="text">This course will be taught using Openframeworks.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward anyone involved in creative projects (designers, makers, artists, musicians, performers etc.) that want to begin incorporating computer vision into their work or practice. The course approaches computer vision from an introductory level, however a basic knowledge of programming (in any language/platform) is encouraged.</p>
