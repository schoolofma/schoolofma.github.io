        <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>


          <p class="text">To be alive is to be waiting for something. But what are we waiting for and why are we waiting for it? With the onslaught of new technologies, we find ourselves waiting even more, often for experiences (AR, VR, etc.), the likes of which are often less than ten minute encounters. With these questions in mind, this program is about waiting and waiting room design from a practical and future perspective. How can we begin to create meaningful designed experiences for waiting rooms? Let's explore this together! </p>

          <p class="text">Omer Fast is a video artist based in Berlin. Much of his work delves into the psychology of contemporary trauma, often relying on the blurring of memory and the retelling of actual events through cinematic convention. Fast’s work moves beyond the formalities of the genre, pushing through reality and non-reality of his subject matter, and is ultimately about the status of the image as a tool to disseminate information, both real and manufactured.</p>

<p class="text">Omer Fast (b. 1972, Jerusalem) will present a solo exhibition of new work in 2019 at the Salzburger Kunstverein, Austria. Other recent solo exhibitions have taken place at the Times Museum, Guangzhou, China; STUK Leuven, Belgium; Minneapolis Institute of Art, MN; and Martin Gropius Bau, Berlin, Germany. In October 2015, a monographic exhibition of Fast’s work titled Present Continuous opened at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, and subsequently travelled to the Baltic Center of Contemporary Arts, Gateshead, UK, and the KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art, Aalborg. Denmark. He has also been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands;  Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden; Le Caixa, Madrid, Spain; Musée d’Art Contemporain, Montréal, Canada; Museum of Contemporary Art, Krakow, Poland; STUK Leuven, Belgium; Dallas Museum of Art, TX; Cleveland Museum of Art, OH; the Art Institute of Chicago, IL; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, NY.</p>

<p class="text">Fast's work was featured in dOCUMENTA (13), the 54th Venice Biennale, and the 2002 and 2008 Whitney Biennials. He received a BFA from Tufts University and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and an MFA from Hunter College in New York City. He is represented by James Cohan, New York.</p>
