      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 2:</strong> Tools and Techniques for creating experimental games through interactive phyiscal computing. Using old devices to create new experimental game artifacts.</p>

      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 3:</strong> Advanced coding techniques.</p>

      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 4:</strong> Creating collective narrative and interactive experiences which will be open to the public for showcase on the final day of the program.</p>

    

      <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?</h4>


      <p class="text">The workshop is suited for anyone interested in familiarising themselves with code, and particularly suited for visual artists and designers keen to augment their practice. In a professional workshop, you will be taught through hands-on and playful explorations, creating visuals, animations, and interactive experiments. You will be provided with with an essential tool kit that can be applied across contexts and problems and will do so in a manner that is fun, accessible, and engaging!</p>

      <p class="text">We will help you develop an understanding of the basic grammar of programming and concepts by working with shapes and colour - then apply this knowledge in coding sessions and share our creations with each other.</p>

      <p class="text">Taking advantage of the transparency code offers as a medium, we will also build on each others code, creating a collection of social artworks - as part of an exciting online exhibition.</p>
