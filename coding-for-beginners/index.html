        <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>

        <p class="text">As we become more connected through technology, understanding how that technology works can be empowering, insightful and practical, especially as coding has become a building block for an increasing number of professions. We hope that by increasing the number of people who can understand code, we can also diversify the voices controlling these technologies.</p> 



          <p class="text">How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories with code? This course will focus on creative coding, narrative, interactivity, and self. The goal is to explore the creative and expressive possibilities of technology, digital tools, and self-expression while gaining a foundation in how to code.</p>
          
        

      <h4 class="title">Course Outline</h4>

      <p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Introductions, concepts, narratives, play, and critical discourse as introduction to coding.</p>

      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 2:</strong> Command line. Tools and Techniques for creating interactivity through code.</p>

      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 3:</strong> Advanced coding techniques.</p>

      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 4:</strong> Creating collective narrative and interactive experiences for showcase to the public on the final day of the program.</p>
