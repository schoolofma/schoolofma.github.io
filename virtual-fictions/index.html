    <p class="text">This course offers a hands-on, intensive study of storymaking and storytelling approaching the theme of virtual reality as a means to transport imagination into fictional narratives and environments. </p>

 <p class="text">In collaboration with an eclectic mix of guest practitioners we will address how different mediums and methodologies can enable us to move into the virtual and to invest in characters, spaces and stories. The emphasis will be on creating immersion - in both a visual and physical sense - through the design and making of new forms of escaping one reality and entering another. </p>

 <p class="text">Participants will build physical and digital scenes to create experiences which transform the studios and streets of Berlin into playful yet compelling elsewheres. </p>

 <p class="text">From drafting initial concepts, through to prototyping, and producing experiential performances, the program will provide an environment to explore the power of fiction as a medium to both enrich and disseminate ideas. Our motivation will be to look beyond the forefront technology enabling a virtual experience and to consider the wider cinematic, psychological and cultural issues of immersive virtuality.</p>

                <p class="text">Anrick is an award-winning interactive filmmaker working at the intersection of storytelling and experiential technology. He's currently focused on exploring Virtual Reality, and is generally interested in how narrative and technology can complement each other.</p>

            <p class="text">Joseph Popper examines space travel and other human technological endeavours by imagining future narratives and simulating fictional experiences. His works depart from developments of the emerging present and seek to project toward things to come.</p> 

            <p class="text">Popper employs handcrafted imagery and built environments in his approach which expose the honesty and rigour of his process. Everyday objects, simple materials and found locations transform into props and stages for playful, critical fictions where the normal is made fantastic.</p> 

            <p class="text">Popper is interested in science fiction as a means to approach unknown frontiers. His narratives often return to a lone character venturing past the possible, and reaching beyond the limits of mundane reality.</p>

            <h5 class="name">Nicholas Mortimer <span class="sub web">/ <a href="http://www.nicholasmortimer.net" target="_blank">nicholasmortimer.net</a></span></h5>
            <p class="text">Nicholas Mortimer brings together cultural studies of media and technology, historical research and theory to explore relations between perceptions of reality, systems of control, and the blurred boundaries of fact and fiction. Within this enquiry there is particular interest in how narratives can be formed to highlight the way in which technological advancements, both  past and present have operated as  catalysts of endeavour, expectation and failure.</p>

            <p class="text">Current work is exploring the extent to which histories of technology can be used to reflect on the outcomes of an expanded computational world. The enquiry seeks to explore the new spaces created between data and knowledge, speed and attention, spaces which are home to changing behaviours enabled by technology of all kinds.  </p>

            <p class="text">The outcome of projects combine; detailed scenography with multilayered narratives to create studies of people and places operating in closed systems, often performing cyclical tasks or banal speculative obsessions which act as absurdist reflections on current or future issues. </p>
                <p class="text">

            <p class="text">He's main interests are related with open source culture in the context of artistic practices and technology literacy and his work has been exhibited in museums like Maison d'Ailleurs in Switzerland, the London Design Museum or Moscow's Multimedia Art Museum among others.</p>
