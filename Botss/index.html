      <p class="text">Bots can be understood as internet-based software applications imbued with character and persona – what Donna Haraway would describe as “materialised figurations.” Bots often follow and reinforce figurations of the humanlike, conversational, assistive and servient. We are exposed to bots daily, whether in customer service chat windows or ubiquitous and opinionated anonymous social media accounts.</p>

<p class="text">Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the design of data-driven programs that autonomously demonstrate intelligent behavior in a variety of domains. ML systems are all around us. When you deposit a check, scan your fingerprint, or post a picture on social media, autonomous algorithms are deployed on the spot to sift through and make sense of your constant interactions with technology.</p>

<p class="text">As computational technologies advance, bots are often mischaracterized as agents with ML, making it hard to distinguish between programmed devices and artificial intelligence. Together, we will learn about bots and ML, understand their differences and explore ways in which ML can transform bots. By integrating these separate components into a common creation, we can repurpose these tools and harness their capabilities for creative expression and empowerment.</p>

      


      <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>


      <!--p class="text">Libraries like TensorFlow.js and ml5.js unlocked new opportunities for interactive machine learning projects in the browser. The goal of this class is to learn and understand common machine learning techniques and apply them to generate creative outputs in the browser.</p>

      <p class="text">This class will start with running models in the browser using high-level APIs from ml5.js, as well as explore the Layer APIs from TensorFlow.js to train models using custom data. This class will also cover preparing the dataset for training models.</p>

      <p class="text">In this class, we will use ml5.js, tf.js, and p5.js to create web apps. For training the model, we will use python, and a tool called Spell that provides remote computing powers for training.</p-->



      <p class="text">In the first week, we’ll get started developing characterisations and roles for bots and immediately begin prototyping them. We’ll explore and invent new figurations for bots, and implement these using bot development tools. Following this, more complex bot architectures can be sketched out, speculatively drawing upon a broader range of APIs and software modules in mashup configurations.</p>

<p class="text">In following weeks, we will focus on learning and understanding common ML techniques and applying them to generate creative outputs within the browser. We will start with running models in the browser using high-level APIs from ml5.js and exploring the Layer APIs from TensorFlow.js to create models using custom data. Libraries like TensorFlow.js and ml5.js will be used to unlock new opportunities for interactive ML projects.</p>

<p class="text">In the final week, combining what we’ve learned, students will continue developing projects as well as collaborate together to integrate their ideas into a group project, with the instructors taking the opportunity to investigate deeper into any special topics the students wish to explore.</p>

      </p>


      <h4 class="title">Course Outline</h4>

      <p><strong>Week 1:</strong>Introduction to Machine Learning, chatBots and artBots</p>

      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 2:</strong> ml5.js, KNN image classifier, poseNet, Style Transfer and Pix2pix</p>

      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 3:</strong> RunwayML, Sketch RNN, Doodle Classifier, tf.js, create our own Neural Network from scratch.</p>

      <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Week 4:</strong>Project development, group work, and special topics, preparing for final showcase open to the public.</p>

      <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?</h4>


      <p class="text">This course is for anyone who is interested in building creative bots and machine learning projects in the browser and programming beginners who would like to learn more about these topics. This class aims to make bots and ML more approachable for a broad audience of artists, designers, creative coders, and programming beginners.</p>

<p class="text">For each model or technique, we will learn how they work, how to use them and how to train our own models. The class will balance its focus between building and understanding how bots and ML works behind the scenes.</p>

<p class="text">Some familiarity with the basic concepts of programming is helpful but is not necessary. We will use ml5 in the class, which is inspired by more user-friendly programming tools such as processing and p5.js.</p>
