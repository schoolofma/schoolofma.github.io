								<p>School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe is a non-profit organisation whose mission is to bring together artists working with technology and hackers working within the context of art, in an intensive, summer learning program in Berlin, Germany. We invite a community of like-minded artists, coders and makers together to creatively explore craft in-depth with a focus on individual self-expression, storytelling and narrative.</p>
								<p>Summer 2014, School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe will run two one-month full-time programs, for 10-15 students each.</p>

								<p>Our July 2014 program will focus on creative coding, interactive public installation and projection-mapping.</p>
								<p>Our August 2014 program will be focused on making+motors, fabrication & making things move.</p>
								<p>Classes will be a mix of lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, hackers and educators, as well as abundant time for self-directed, hands-on learning. Students will also have opportunities to share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops. In addition, we will organise weekly artist-talks/discussion groups for participants with invited guest speakers.</p>
