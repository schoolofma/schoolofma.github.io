    <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >How can we create meaningful experiences using data to explore the facts and fictions of our modern-day lives? How can a thoughtful and more personal exploration of data visualisation and storytelling provide new ways of understanding the world around us and ourselves? In this four-week program we'll take a hands-on approach to exploring these questions and more in a variety of conceptual, digital, and physical formats.

          <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >The relationship between data (information) and stories is rich and multi-layered. Now more than ever, questioning the origins of our data and how it is collected is essential to our understanding of it.</strong> With an eye on perception, objectivity, critical thinking, analysis, misinformation and truth, we’ll examine data, and in turn data visualisation, in all its grotesque and beautiful facets, focusing on the finer details of how to pull a story from data and craft it into something meaningful.</p>

          <p>Throughout the program, you’ll explore the seen and the unseen. You’ll go from conceptualising to sketching and playing with data, challenging yourself to interact with data in visceral and unconventional ways. You'll learn methods to collect and gather data both off- and online. Once you’ve established your dataset, you'll explore ways to communicate your story using layout and design. You’ll also learn how to take your data into the physical realm, creating objects using 3D printing and lasercutting techniques.</p>

          <p>Each participant will have an opportunity to come up with a concept which is meaningful to them. By the second week we'll begin focusing on individual topics and research, learning how to gather and work with data significant to the project you are creating. <strong style="font-weight: bold;" >The program culminates in an exhibition of your work in a final group show.</p>

          <p>Whether you’re a designer who longs to integrate data into your work, a seasoned data analyst who wants to communicate data in more engaging and artistic ways, or you’re someone who simply dreams of working in the field of data visualisation and data storytelling and are seeking a creative and in-depth foundation from which to begin, we encourage you to join us!</strong></p>

<h3>The Schedule</h3>
          

<p><a href="http://www.stefanieposavec.co.uk" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Stefanie Posavec</a> will be with us during week one to cover concepts and theory, exploring esoteric and unusual places to find data, using her <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Dear Data</a> project as reference. We'll have assignments, going out into the city to collect data and working towards a unique perspective on what to do with the data once we've got it. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.this-is-maral.com/about/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Maral Pourkazemi</a> will join at the end of the week to discuss her own work and share inspiration and highlights from the upcoming <a href="http://visualized.com/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Visualized</a> conference taking place in NY October 8-9. </p>



<p><a href="http://feltron.com/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Nicholas Felton</a> will give an intensive two-day workshop over the weekend, sharing his own unique perspective on working with data. Following this, on Monday he'll be around to discuss one-on-one with students regarding the direction of their final projects. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.miriamquick.com" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Miriam Quick</a> will spend the next two weeks sharing her in-depth knowledge as we begin developing creative concepts, research techniques, gathering and processing data from the web using scraping and API's, identifying relationships, finding stories and using visualising tools along the way. She'll also cover collaboration techniques when working with other designers and developers as a necessary part of the process.</p>

<p>Along with working with data inside the computer, we'll also explore what it means to take data out of it, learning to use lasercutting and 3D printing as a means to visualise data in the physical world.</p>

<p>There will be several guests and studio tours throughout the program. We'll visit and hear from some of Berlin's best talent working creatively with data, including <a href="http://www.nand.io/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">StudioNAND</a> and <a href="http://www.onformative.com/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Onformative</a> studios. </p>

<p>Data analyst <a href="http://www.science-craft.com/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Rick Scavetta</a> will join to discuss the truths and untruths that data can tell. The <a href="https://tacticaltech.org/" class="apply danger" target="_blank">Tactical Technology Collective</a>, themselves dedicated to the use of information in activism will also join us as we delve into discourse about data ethics.</p>

<p>From week two onward, students will choose a topic to explore which will be used to guide their individual progress throughout the remainder of the program. At the end of the course, there will be a final
exhibition of student work.</p>

      <p class="title"><i>Learning with a bunch of creative and skilled misfits couldn't have been more fun. The school took us from zero to sixty in one month, starting at the basics and ending with a public show of collaborative work. I understand the world of digital art in a deeper and practical way now. I'm proud to have been so immersed in Berlin culture with such a productive outcome.</i></p>

      <p class="title"><i>I learnt so many things that cannot be summarized in a paragraph. But most importantly I learnt to appreciate art, how to use it as medium to change the way people think, inspire others and as a way to express yourself. Also how technology can assist us to express the artistic and creative views of a non-artist like me. </i></p>
