                            <p>Lovely! The admissions process works like this: Once you've applied to School of MA, your application will be reviewed within a few days. You'll receive an e-mail from us and we'll schedule an online call. The call is a chance for us to get to know each other and for you to ask questions about the program. Soon after, you'll know if you're in! </p> 

				            <p>If so, we'll then ask that you transfer a small deposit fee to us (30% of program cost) within one week to confirm your participation. Pretty standard procedure really.</p>
				            
                            <p>This rolling admissions process is intended to make it easier for those of you travelling from abroad and needing to make plans and travel arrangements asap!</p>

                            <p>In order to accommodate a diverse group with different backgrounds and financial means, we now offer two price categories rather than a one-size-fits-all price tag. For some people, this may still be an expensive undertaking. However, the unique, high quality, focused, and individual instruction plus the amazing network of people you'll meet is priceless. </p>

				            <p>We offer four-week, full-time fully-immersive programs! Take a look at the work of our amazing instructors and you'll understand; we *could* be charging a lot more. </p>

                            <p>Most of our programs do require a full-time commitment and we're looking for people who can dedicate themselves to it. We've all taken two day courses and shorter programs. If we learn something but don't have time to use those skills, we easily forget. </p>

				            <p>If you have to do some part-time work on the side, we completely understand. It's just that you'll be able to get more out of the program if you're able to set your work aside for evenings and weekends.</p>


				            <p>We believe in full-immersion so that the new things you learn will stick with you. Our hope for you is that once you leave you'll be armed with a new concrete toolset and can quite easily dream up new ideas and actually know how to turn those ideas into tangible reality.</p>

                            <p>The curious and inquisitive kind, creative people or the kind of people who yearn to be creative. We, also really like nice people and those who enjoy helping others and sharing knowledge. Hi-five if this sounds like you!</p>

				            <p>More specifically, we'd love to find people ready to experiment, to dream up new ideas and to learn the skills to make these ideas come to life.  Technology has been advancing quickly. The things we're able to learn now weren't available back in the day. We're excited for people who've already started down a path that no longer fits them to join us, and push their own unique, creative ideas forward into the future. 

				            <p>In short, openness, the ability to work well with others, enthusiasm, and positivity are all traits we look for in potential students.</p>

                            <p>Our four week programs are full-time which means they run from approximately 10am--7pm each day, with an hour break for lunch. Sometimes we'll have guest speakers and in the afternoons you can take advantage of open lab time or to explore the city a bit, as you see fit. 

				            <p>Lately, we've been encouraging students to use fridays as a chance to share knowledge and skills with each other and it's been brilliant. </p>

				            <p>In general, our programs are a mix of&nbsp;lectures, labs, artist talks, field trips, plus lots of&nbsp;time to experiment and create.  It's intensive but will probably be one of the most freeing, creative, and productive times of your life. How lucky for you to have found us!</p>

The money is&nbsp;being used for materials and to allow an amazing community of&nbsp;people to&nbsp;come together, all of&nbsp;whom are passionate about dreaming up&nbsp;ideas and seeing how far they can push the technology, the creativity, and themselves. It's a&nbsp;unique opportunity to&nbsp;collaborate with and learn from everyone participating and to&nbsp;create something amazing from nothing.

                            <p>Funny you ask! Soon we'll begin offering live online classes, as well! Initially, the focus will be on a mix of art, creative technology, and activism. We've had many great instructors come through and quite a few of them are doing important work in these areas. It's quite a critical time in the world and we really want to help get these important messages out into the world far and wide. We hope to announce these classes soon along with the rest of our 2017 schedule. Sign up for our newsletter and stay tuned!</p>

                            <p>Well, for the most part that would be me, Rachel Uwa, although lately I've got a lovely band of cohorts by way of former students to experiment and do cool things with via the school.<p>A few years ago, I participated in&nbsp;some amazing programs in&nbsp;NYC, namely &nbsp;ITP&nbsp;Camp and School for Poetic Computation. SFPC clarified a lot and gave me direction which I can't thank them enough for! Zach, Amit, Taeyoon, Jen and the first class of SFPC were a huge inspiration and I will always try to live up to that in whatever it is the School&nbsp;of&nbsp;Machines, Making&nbsp;&&nbsp;Make-Believe becomes! </p><p>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;bring similar kinds of&nbsp;experiences to&nbsp;Europe and the rest of the world. And I am!</p> <p>Honestly, I&nbsp;was thinking about something like this even before then. Participating in&nbsp;those programs just helped me solidify in&nbsp;my mind what I want to do for the rest of&nbsp;my life: explore art, creative technologies, and being human while helping others do the same! I'm in Berlin, and easy to find. Come join me!</p>
