			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The money we&nbsp;receive will go&nbsp;entirely back into the school to&nbsp;pay for our awesome facility, awesome instructors, admin, taxes, etc. We&nbsp;will also cover the cost of&nbsp;materials, as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;we&nbsp;can anyway, until the money runs out!</p>

			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Sorry, only people who can dedicate the entire month to&nbsp;learning, playing and having the time of&nbsp;their life should apply.</p>
