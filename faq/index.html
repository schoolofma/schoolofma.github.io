				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">The School sounds like a perfect fit for me! How does the admissions process work?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Lovely! The admissions process works like this: Once you've applied to School of MA, your application will be reviewed within a few days. You'll receive an e-mail from us and we'll schedule an online call. The call is a chance for us to get to know each other and for you to ask questions about the program. Soon after, you'll know if you're in! 

				<p>If so, we'll then ask that you transfer a small deposit fee to us (30% of program cost) within one week to confirm your participation. Pretty standard procedure really.</p>
				<p>This rolling admissions process is intended to make it easier for those of you travelling from abroad and needing to make plans and travel arrangements asap!</p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Do you offer assistance or scholarships?</strong></h4>
				</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>In order to accommodate a diverse group with different backgrounds and financial means, we now offer two price categories rather than a one-size-fits-all price tag. For some people, this may still be an expensive undertaking. However, the unique, high quality, focused, and individual instruction plus the amazing network of people you'll meet is priceless. We offer four-week, full-time fully-immersive programs! Take a look at the work of our amazing instructors and you'll understand; we *could* be charging a lot more. </p> 

			</dd>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Can I&nbsp;attend part-time?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Most of our programs do require a full-time commitment and we're looking for people who can dedicate themselves to it. We've all taken two day courses and shorter programs. If we learn something but don't have time to use those skills, we easily forget. </p>

				<p>If you have to do some part-time work on the side, we completely understand. It's just that you'll be able to get more out of the program if you're able to set your work aside for evenings and weekends.</p>


				<p>We believe in full-immersion so that the new things you learn will stick with you. Our hope for you is that once you leave you'll be armed with a new concrete toolset and can quite easily dream up new ideas and actually know how to turn those ideas into tangible reality.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">What kind of&nbsp;students are you looking for?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The curious and inquisitive kind, creative people or&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;people who yearn to&nbsp;be&nbsp;creative. We,&nbsp;also really like nice people and those who enjoy helping others and sharing knowledge. Hi-five if&nbsp;this sounds like you!</p>

				<p>More specifically, we'd love to find people ready to experiment, to dream up new ideas and to learn the skills to make these ideas come to life.  Technology has been advancing quickly. The things we're able to learn now weren't available back in the day. We're excited for people who've already started down a path that no longer fits them to join us, and push their own unique, creative ideas forward into the future. 

				<p>In short, openness, the ability to work well with others, enthusiasm and positivity are all key.</p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Do&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;have prior experience before signing&nbsp;up?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>No,&nbsp;but you can! For most of our programs, we don't expect any prior knowledge but if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;have some, you may be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;push yourself further much faster. We&nbsp;have some really great instructors and no&nbsp;doubt you will learn a&nbsp;lot from them and from the other students, regardless of&nbsp;your current skill level. This is&nbsp;not about being the smartest, it's&nbsp;about learning to&nbsp;expose your creative innards to&nbsp;the world in&nbsp;your own unique way and working with new tools and people who can help make it&nbsp;happen.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">You say programs are full-time, what does that mean exactly?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Our four week programs are full-time which means they run from approximately 10am--7pm, Monday through Thursday with an hour break for lunch. Sometimes we'll have guest speakers on Fridays. Some Fridays you'll be free to take advantage of open lab time or to explore the city a bit, as you see fit. Lately, we've been encouraging students to use fridays as a chance to share knowledge and skills with each other and it's been brilliant. In general, our programs are a mix of&nbsp;lectures, labs, artist talks, plus lots of&nbsp;time to experiment and create.  It's intensive but will probably be one of the most freeing, creative, and productive times of your life. How lucky for you to have found us!</p>

			<dt class="question">	
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Do you offer any help with obtaining a visa?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>If you are selected to attend the School, we can send you an official letter of&nbsp;participation if that helps, but we don't have the capacity to help out much more than that. That being said, if you will require a visa, send us an email and we'll make reviewing your application a priority so do get in touch: info@schoolofma.org</p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Out of curiosity, how is the school funded?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">

				
				<p>Currently we're funded solely through student fees. </br>All the money we&nbsp;receive goes&nbsp;entirely back into the school to&nbsp;pay for our wonderful facilities, brilliant instructors, admin, taxes, etc. </p>  


				<p>This is a grassroots program driven only by passion and a belief in the power of art, technology, and education as an inevitable force for creating social change.  While we do have a fiscal sponsor, OpenTechSchool e.V., we're currently in the process of establishing ourselves as a legal non-profit entity.</p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">What does the tuition NOT cover?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The tuition does not cover housing or&nbsp;travel to/from our location.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">What about sponsors or other funding?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>I'm more than happy to speak with potential sponsors about funding, by&nbsp;all means&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;give them my number! +49 151 753 74 602</p>
			</dd>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Cool. Any final words on finances?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>We've tried to&nbsp;keep the costs down as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;humanly possible! That being said, you're not just paying for classes. The money is&nbsp;being used for materials and to allow an amazing community of&nbsp;people to&nbsp;come together, all of&nbsp;whom are passionate about dreaming up&nbsp;ideas and seeing how far they can push the technology, the creativity, and themselves. It's a&nbsp;unique opportunity to&nbsp;collaborate with and learn from everyone participating and to&nbsp;create something amazing from nothing. Even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;parallel universe I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;would cost just as much, if&nbsp;not more than what we're charging! But good luck getting a&nbsp;cheap ticket to&nbsp;that place.</p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">And your programs are based where?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Our upcoming spring and summer programs will all be taking place in Berlin, Germany, our home base. We're also organising a creative research residency for the first time which is slated to take place in Belgrade, Serbia, this April. </p>

			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Do you have any other kinds of programs in the works?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Funny you ask! Soon we'll begin offering live online classes, as well! Initially, the focus will be on a mix of art, creative technology, and activism. We've had many great instructors come through and quite a few of them are doing important work in these areas. It's quite a critical time in the world and we really want to help get these important messages out into the world far and wide. We hope to announce these classes soon along with the rest of our 2017 schedule. Sign up for our newsletter and stay tuned!</p>

			<dt class="question">	
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Thanks! You keep saying "we", but who is organising all this?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
			<p>Well, for the most part that would be me, Rachel Uwa, although lately I've got a lovely band of cohorts by way of former students to experiment and do cool things with via the school.<p>A few years ago, I participated in&nbsp;some amazing programs in&nbsp;NYC, namely &nbsp;ITP&nbsp;Camp and School for Poetic Computation. SFPC clarified a lot and gave me direction which I can't thank them enough for! Zach, Amit, Taeyoon, Jen and the first class of SFPC were a huge inspiration and I will always try to live up to that in whatever it is the School&nbsp;of&nbsp;Machines, Making&nbsp;&&nbsp;Make-Believe becomes! </p><p>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;bring similar kinds of&nbsp;experiences to&nbsp;Europe and the rest of the world. And I am!</p> <p>Honestly, I&nbsp;was thinking about something like this even before then. Participating in&nbsp;those programs just helped me solidify in&nbsp;my mind what I want to do for the rest of&nbsp;my life: invent experiences, explore creative technologies, and help define what those technologies will become! I'm in Berlin, and easy to find. Come join me!</p>
