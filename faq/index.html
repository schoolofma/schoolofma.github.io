				<h4>Great, I'm excited! How does the admissions process work?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Once you've applied to School of MA, your application will be reviewed. Within a few days, you'll receive an e-mail from us with follow-up questions. In order to keep the process moving, we ask you to please reply within 3 working days. Once we hear back from you, we'll schedule a Skype call. The call is a chance to get to know you better and for you to ask questions about the program. Within 3 days after the Skype call you'll know if you're in! If you are, we ask that you transfer a non-refundable deposit to us (within one week), to confirm you participation. Pretty standard procedure really. Questions? <a href="mailto:info@schoolofma.org" subject="Question about the School!">Email us</a>!</p>
				<p>This rolling admissions process is intended to make it easier for those of you travelling from abroad and needing to make plans and travel arrangements.</p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4>The School sounds like a&nbsp;perfect fit for&nbsp;me! How much does it&nbsp;cost?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Tuition is:<br>
					€3999* early bird (before April 20) <br>
					€4399* full-price tuition for our&nbsp;full-time, 10-week summer program <br>
					*Prices include mandatory 19% VAT. </p>

				<p>We highly suggest you apply before April 20th! Applying early not only helps us to plan, it helps you out, too: earlybird discounted price is a €400 savings. The enrollment period closes for good on June 1st, or once we're full, whichever comes first.</p>
				<p>We will be accepting only 10 students per track. Be one of the lucky ones!</p>
			</dd>
			
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>What does the cost cover?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The money we&nbsp;receive will go&nbsp;entirely back into the school to&nbsp;pay for our wonderful facility <a href="http://www.nkprojekt.de/" title="NKProject">N.K.</a>, brilliant instructors, admin, taxes, etc. We&nbsp;will also cover the cost of&nbsp;basic materials and components for the classroom, as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;we&nbsp;can anyway, until the money runs out!</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>What does the tuition NOT cover?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The tuition does not cover housing or&nbsp;travel to/from Berlin. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a relatively inexpensive city, though. You can often find a room for about €300/mo. We're happy to help spread the word if you'll be needing a place. Not one of our students has ended up homeless so far, not to our knowledge anyway. Haha. No, don't worry, you will not be homeless!</p>
			</dd>

				<dt class="question">
				<h4>I'm interested but don't think I can afford it. Do you offer assistance?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>At this time, we currently do not have any means to provide financial assistnace. But if you're really interested in attending, we encourage you to be proactive about your education. Students in the past have been quite resourceful. Ask your company if they can help sponsor you, pointing out that the skills you learn will benefit them also in the end. If you're a student, ask your student advisor. Often times schools have funds allocated for additional education expenses for students. We've also heard, sometimes banks offer scholarships for students to travel abroad in summer. Bottom line is, it doesn't hurt to ask! </p>
				<p> Other options are, crowdfunding. There are various platforms. Tilt is one we've heard about but there are of course many others!
				 </p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>What about sponsors?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>If we find paying sponsors and all other costs are covered, we&nbsp;will bring the price of&nbsp;tuition down or refund some money. That being said, if you know of&nbsp;any glorious people willing to&nbsp;help fund us &mdash; by&nbsp;all means&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;give them my number! +49 151 753 74 602</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>Cool. Any final words on finances?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>We've tried to&nbsp;keep the costs down as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;humanly possible! In&nbsp;an attempt to&nbsp;be transparent, we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;posting all of&nbsp;our finances online. That being said, you're not just paying for classes. The money is&nbsp;being used to&nbsp;allow an amazing community of&nbsp;people to&nbsp;come together, all of&nbsp;whom are passionate about dreaming up&nbsp;ideas and seeing how far they can push the technology, the art and themselves. It's a&nbsp;unique opportunity to&nbsp;collaborate with and learn from everyone participating and to&nbsp;create something amazing from nothing. Even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;parallel universe I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;would cost €3999, if&nbsp;not more! But good luck getting a&nbsp;cheap ticket to&nbsp;that place.</p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4>Thanks for answering my&nbsp;money questions, now about the School. Can I&nbsp;attend part-time?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The program requires a full-time commitment and we are looking for people who can dedicate the full ten weeks to it.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>What kind of&nbsp;students are you looking for?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The curious and inquisitive kind, creative people or&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;people who yearn to&nbsp;be&nbsp;creative. We,&nbsp;also really like nice people and those who enjoy helping others and sharing knowledge. Hi-five if&nbsp;this sounds like you!</p>

				<p>More specifically, this summer program is a bit focused on coding, so if you're just learning how to code or interested in improving your coding skills and getting more into processing or p5.js (and other frameworks), this program is for you!</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>Do&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;code before signing&nbsp;up?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>No,&nbsp;but you can! We&nbsp;don't expect any prior knowledge but if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;have some, you may be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;push yourself further much faster. We&nbsp;have some really great instructors and no&nbsp;doubt you will learn a&nbsp;lot from them and from the other students, regardless of&nbsp;your current skill level. This is&nbsp;not about being the smartest, it's&nbsp;about learning to&nbsp;expose your creative innards to&nbsp;the world in&nbsp;your own unique way and working with new tools and people who can help make it&nbsp;happen.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>You say the program is full-time, what does that mean exactly?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>There will be a morning check-in beginning at&nbsp;10am, and one main class a day Mo-Thurs. (one for each track) with a break for lunchtime of course. There will be an electronics and sensors class once a week and of course free-time each day to&nbsp;work or extra tutoring if you need it. Sometimes we'll have visitors and guest speakers and field trips! Each day will vary but there should be a rough schedule at the beginning of&nbsp;every week and we&nbsp;will try our hardest to&nbsp;stick with. Again, it's a mix of&nbsp;lectures, labs, artist talks, plus lots of&nbsp;time to experiment! Fun times!</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">	
				<h4>Both tracks sound exciting! Can I take both?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
			<p>If you've already got a little experience with coding and feel confident that you can handle it, we'll consider it. It's definitely doable but perhaps not recommended. In order for you to get the most out of the program or even in general, never underestimate the power of focusing on one thing at a time! But if you're really hellbent on it, let's talk!</p>

			</dd>
			<dt class="question">	
				<h4>Do you offer any help with obtaining a visa?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>If you are selected to attend the School, we can send you an official letter of&nbsp;participation if that helps, but we don't have the capacity to help out much more than that. That being said, if you will require a visa, send us an email and we'll make reviewing your application a priority so do get in touch: info@schoolofma.org</p>
			</dd>
			<!--
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>And the program will be based where?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>At <a href="http://www.thewye.de/" title="The WYE" target="_blank">The WYE</a>, an Art & Technology hub in the heart of Berlin, Kreuzberg! It's about a five minute walk from the bridge seen in the great german flick, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppeZQ8inevE" title="Run Lola Run" target="_blank">Run Lola Run</a>. We can totally do that run together when you're here!</p>
			</dd>

			<dt class="question">	
				<h4>Thanks! You keep saying "we", but who is organising all this?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
			<p>Well, that would be me! Hi, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/onna_no_hito" title="Rachel">Rachel</a>, nice to meet you:) I've been helping to organise workshops, meetups, conferences, festivals and all kinds of&nbsp;tech- (and non-tech) related events, for years. I've worked in&nbsp;audio, vfx and over the last couple of&nbsp;years, started learning about this magical world of&nbsp;art & tech.</p><p>I participated in&nbsp;some amazing programs in&nbsp;NY&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; in 2013, shout out to&nbsp;ITP&nbsp;Camp and School for Poetic Computation, yo! SFPC clarified a lot and gave me direction which I can't thank them all enough for! Zach, Amit, Taeyoon, Jen and the first class of SFPC were a huge inspiration and I will try to live up to that in whatever it is the School&nbsp;of&nbsp;Machines, Making&nbsp;&&nbsp;Make-Believe becomes! Honestly, I&nbsp;was thinking about something like this even before then. Participating in&nbsp;those programs just helped me solidify in&nbsp;my mind what I want to do for the rest of&nbsp;my life: learn, and play forever with machines, making and make-believe!</p><p>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;bring the same kind of&nbsp;experience to&nbsp;Europe and the rest of the world. Come <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1D8ejtJC9BvtFPRzMIaTwq8eIYSUgL4ZfcrQvIcEsTmc/viewform" title="join us" Camp>join&nbsp;us</a>! </p>
