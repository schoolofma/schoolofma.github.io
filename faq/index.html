			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">The School sounds like a&nbsp;perfect fit for&nbsp;me! How are you funded?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">

				
				<p>Currently we're funded entirely by student fees.  </p> 

								
				<p>All the money we&nbsp;receive goes&nbsp;entirely back into the school to&nbsp;pay for our wonderful facilities, brilliant instructors, admin, taxes, etc. </p>  


				<p>This is a grassroots program driven only by passion and a belief in the power of art, technology, and education as an inevitable force for creating social change.  While we do have a fiscal sponsor, OpenTechSchool e.V., we're currently in the process of establishing ourselves as a legal non-profit entity.</p>
			</dd>
				<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Do you offer assistance or scholarships?</strong></h4>
				</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>In order to accommodate a diverse group with different backgrounds and financial means, we now offer two price categories rather than a one-size-fits-all price tag. For some people, this may still be an expensive undertaking. However, the unique, high quality, focused, and individual instruction plus the amazing network of people you'll meet is priceless. We offer four-week, full-time fully-immersive programs! Take a look at the work of our amazing instructors and you'll understand; we *could* be charging a lot more. </p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">What does the tuition NOT cover?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The tuition does not cover housing or&nbsp;travel to/from our location.</p>
			</dd>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">What about sponsors or other funding?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>I'm more than happy to speak with potential sponsors about funding, by&nbsp;all means&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;give them my number! +49 151 753 74 602</p>
			</dd>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Cool. Any final words on finances?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>We've tried to&nbsp;keep the costs down as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;humanly possible! That being said, you're not just paying for classes. The money is&nbsp;being used to&nbsp;allow an amazing community of&nbsp;people to&nbsp;come together, all of&nbsp;whom are passionate about dreaming up&nbsp;ideas and seeing how far they can push the technology, the creativity and themselves. It's a&nbsp;unique opportunity to&nbsp;collaborate with and learn from everyone participating and to&nbsp;create something amazing from nothing. Even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;parallel universe I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;would cost just as much, if&nbsp;not more than what we're charging! But good luck getting a&nbsp;cheap ticket to&nbsp;that place.</p>

			<dt class="question">
			
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Thanks for answering my&nbsp;money questions! Now how does the admissions process work?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>You're welcome! So the admissions process works like this: Once you've applied to School of MA, your application will be reviewed. Within a few days, you'll receive an e-mail from us and we'll schedule an online call. The call is a chance to get to know you better and for you to ask questions about the program.Soon after, you'll know if you're in! If you are, we ask that you transfer a non-refundable deposit to us (within one week), to confirm your participation. Pretty standard procedure really. Any questions? <a href="mailto:info@schoolofma.org" subject="Question about the School!">get in touch</a>!</p>
				<p>This rolling admissions process is intended to make it easier for those of you travelling from abroad and needing to make plans and travel arrangements asap!</p>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Can I&nbsp;attend part-time?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The program requires a full-time commitment and we are looking for people who can dedicate the full four weeks to it. We've all taken two day courses and shorter programs. If we learn something but don't have time to use those skills, we easily forget. We believe in full-immersion so that the new things you learn will stick with you. Our hope for you is that once you leave you'll be armed with a new concrete toolset and can quite easily dream up new ideas and actually know how to turn those ideas into tangible reality.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">What kind of&nbsp;students are you looking for?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The curious and inquisitive kind, creative people or&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;people who yearn to&nbsp;be&nbsp;creative. We,&nbsp;also really like nice people and those who enjoy helping others and sharing knowledge. Hi-five if&nbsp;this sounds like you!</p>

				<p>More specifically, we'd love to find people ready to experiment, to dream up new ideas and to learn the skills to make these ideas come to life!</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Do&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;have prior experience before signing&nbsp;up?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>No,&nbsp;but you can! We&nbsp;don't expect any prior knowledge but if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;have some, you may be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;push yourself further much faster. We&nbsp;have some really great instructors and no&nbsp;doubt you will learn a&nbsp;lot from them and from the other students, regardless of&nbsp;your current skill level. This is&nbsp;not about being the smartest, it's&nbsp;about learning to&nbsp;expose your creative innards to&nbsp;the world in&nbsp;your own unique way and working with new tools and people who can help make it&nbsp;happen.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">You say the program is full-time, what does that mean exactly?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Class will run from 10am--7pm, Monday through Thursday with an hour break for lunch. Sometimes we'll have guest speakers on Fridays. Some Fridays you'll be free to take advantage of open lab time or to explore the city a bit, as you see fit. The program is a mix of&nbsp;lectures, labs, artist talks, plus lots of&nbsp;time to experiment and create.  It's intensive but will probably be one of the most freeing, creative, and productive times of your life. How lucky for you to have found us!</p>

			<dt class="question">	
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Do you offer any help with obtaining a visa?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>If you are selected to attend the School, we can send you an official letter of&nbsp;participation if that helps, but we don't have the capacity to help out much more than that. That being said, if you will require a visa, send us an email and we'll make reviewing your application a priority so do get in touch: info@schoolofma.org</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">And the program will be based where?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Our Coming Soon program will take place at several locations in Turin, Italy, all closely connected to each other. They are: Officine Arduino, Fablab Torino and Casa Jasmina.</a>.</p>

			<dt class="question">	
				<h4><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Thanks! You keep saying "we", but who is organising all this?</strong></h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
			<p>Well, that would be me. Hi, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/onna_no_hito" title="Rachel">Rachel</a>, nice to meet you! I've been helping to organise workshops, meetups, conferences, festivals and all kinds of&nbsp;tech- (and non-tech) related events, for years. I've worked in&nbsp;audio, vfx and over the last couple of&nbsp;years, started learning about this magical world of&nbsp;art & technology.</p><p>I participated in&nbsp;some amazing programs in&nbsp;NY&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; in 2013, &nbsp;ITP&nbsp;Camp and School for Poetic Computation! SFPC clarified a lot and gave me direction which I can't thank them enough for! Zach, Amit, Taeyoon, Jen and the first class of SFPC were a huge inspiration and I will try to live up to that in whatever it is the School&nbsp;of&nbsp;Machines, Making&nbsp;&&nbsp;Make-Believe becomes! </p><p>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;bring the same kind of&nbsp;experience to&nbsp;Europe and the rest of the world. And I am! Honestly, I&nbsp;was thinking about something like this even before then. Participating in&nbsp;those programs just helped me solidify in&nbsp;my mind what I want to do for the rest of&nbsp;my life: learn, and play forever with machines, making and make-believe!</p>
