			<dt class="question">
				<h4>The School sounds like a&nbsp;perfect fit for&nbsp;me! How much does it&nbsp;cost?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Tuition is&nbsp;€1600 (early bird--apply by 27th February) for the&nbsp;full-time, five-week program in Belgrade, Serbia. Applying afterwards? The price is €1900.  </p>
			</dd>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4>What does the cost cover?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The money we&nbsp;receive will go&nbsp;entirely back into the school to&nbsp;pay for our amazing facility (<a href="http://www.ukparobrod.rs/o-nama-en" title="UKParabrod">UKParabrod</a>), brilliant instructors, admin, taxes, etc. We&nbsp;will also cover the cost of&nbsp;basic materials and components for the classroom, as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;we&nbsp;can anyway, until the money runs out!</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>What does the tuition NOT cover?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The tuition does not cover housing or&nbsp;travel to/from Belgrade. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a relatively inexpensive city, though. Even just looking on Airbnb you'll find rooms for €15/night and monthly rent from €300. We can also help look into group housing options if some of you would like to share flats while you're here.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>Cool. Anything else you can say to&nbsp;convince&nbsp;me?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>We've tried to&nbsp;keep the costs down as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;humanly possible! In&nbsp;an attempt to&nbsp;be transparent, we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;posting all of&nbsp;our finances online. That being said, you're not just paying for classes. The money is&nbsp;being used to&nbsp;allow an amazing community of&nbsp;people to&nbsp;come together, all of&nbsp;whom are passionate about dreaming up&nbsp;ideas and seeing how far they can push the technology, the art and themselves. It's a&nbsp;unique opportunity to&nbsp;collaborate with and learn from everyone participating and to&nbsp;create something amazing from nothing. Even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;parallel universe I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;would cost €1600, if&nbsp;not more! But good luck getting a&nbsp;cheap ticket to&nbsp;that place.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>What about sponsors?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>If we find paying sponsors and all other costs are covered, we&nbsp;will bring the price of&nbsp;tuition down or refund some money. That being said, if you know of&nbsp;any glorious people willing to&nbsp;help fund us &mdash; by&nbsp;all means&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;give them my number! +49 151 753 74 602</p>
			</dd>

			<dt class="question">
				<h4>Thanks for answering my&nbsp;money questions, now about the School. Can I&nbsp;attend part-time?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The program requires a full-time commitment and we are looking for people who can dedicate the full five weeks to it.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>What kind of&nbsp;students are you looking for?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>The curious and inquisitive kind, creative people or&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;people who yearn to&nbsp;be&nbsp;creative. We,&nbsp;also really like nice people and those who enjoy helping others and sharing knowledge. Hi-five if&nbsp;this sounds like you!</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>Do&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;program or&nbsp;build circuits before signing&nbsp;up?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>No,&nbsp;but you can! We&nbsp;don't expect any prior knowledge but if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;have some, you may be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;push yourself further much faster. We&nbsp;have some really great instructors and no&nbsp;doubt you will learn a&nbsp;lot from them and from the other students, regardless of&nbsp;your current skill level. This is&nbsp;not about being the smartest, it's&nbsp;about learning to&nbsp;expose your creative innards to&nbsp;the world in&nbsp;your own unique way and working with new tools and people who can help make it&nbsp;happen.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>You say the program is full-time, what does that mean exactly?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>Most days we will have a morning check-in beginning at&nbsp;10am, and then a morning class 'til around lunchtime. Some days there will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;class or a talk going on until 9pm, with free-time in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the day to&nbsp;work or extra tutoring if you need it. Each day will vary but there should be a rough schedule at the beginning of&nbsp;every week and we&nbsp;will try our hardest to&nbsp;stick with. Again, it's a mix of&nbsp;lectures, labs, artist talks, plus lots of&nbsp;time to experiment! In addition, we'll be travelling to the mountains of Kopaonik to do some investigating with nature and technology mid-program--a vacation inside of a vacation of sorts! Fun times!</p>

			<dt class="question">	
				<h4>Do you offer any help with obtaining a visa?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>If you are selected to attend the School, we can send you an official letter of&nbsp;participation if that helps, but we don't have the capacity to help out much more than that. That being said, if you will require a visa, send us an email and we'll make reviewing your application a priority so do get in touch: info@schoolofma.org</p>
			</dd>
			<!--
			<dt class="question">
				<h4>And the program will be based where?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
				<p>At <a href="http://www.thewye.de/" title="The WYE" target="_blank">The WYE</a>, an Art & Technology hub in the heart of Berlin, Kreuzberg! It's about a five minute walk from the bridge seen in the great german flick, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppeZQ8inevE" title="Run Lola Run" target="_blank">Run Lola Run</a>. We can totally do that run together when you're here!</p>

				<h4>Thanks! You keep saying "we", but who is organising all this?</h4>
			</dt>
			<dd class="answer">
			<p>Well, that would be me! Hi, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/onna_no_hito" title="Rachel">Rachel</a>, nice to meet you:) I've been helping to organise workshops, meetups, conferences, festivals and all kinds of&nbsp;tech- (and non-tech) related events, for years. I've worked in&nbsp;audio, vfx and over the last couple of&nbsp;years, started learning about this magical world of&nbsp;art & tech.</p><p>I participated in&nbsp;some amazing programs in&nbsp;NY&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; in 2013, shout out to&nbsp;ITP&nbsp;Camp and School for Poetic Computation, yo! SFPC clarified a lot and gave me direction which I can't thank them all enough for! Zach, Amit, Taeyoon, Jen and the first class of SFPC were a huge inspiration and I will try to live up to that in whatever it is the School&nbsp;of&nbsp;Machines, Making&nbsp;&&nbsp;Make-Believe becomes! Honestly, I&nbsp;was thinking about something like this even before then. Participating in&nbsp;those programs just helped me solidify in&nbsp;my mind what I want to do for the rest of&nbsp;my life: learn, and play forever with machines, making and make-believe!</p><p>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;bring the same kind of&nbsp;experience to&nbsp;Europe. This year in 2015, we're organising a one-month program called <a href="http://schoolofma.org/programs/" title="Fabricating Empathy">'Fabricating Empathy'</a> in Belgrade, Serbia in Spring and a three-month summer program in Berlin (more details to come). Needless to&nbsp;say, we do&nbsp;hope you will <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1D8ejtJC9BvtFPRzMIaTwq8eIYSUgL4ZfcrQvIcEsTmc/viewform" title="join us" Camp>join&nbsp;us</a>! </p>
