<h5 class="title">How It Works</h5>
       <p class="text">Welcome to our online courses! Soon we will create an FAQ for these programs. For now, it's important to note that these online classes will be taking place over the course of four weeks, for two hours each week. Plan in an extra hour for homework and you'll be set!</p>

       <p class="text">Classes are live meaning that you can directly interact with the instructor as well as with the other participants from around the world. Classes will also be recorded for playback in case you are unable to attend for any reason. More info coming soon! For specific questions, please email info[at]schoolofma.org</p>

            <p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >How can artists, activists, designers and other creative minds take a stand and be heard in these days and age of ecological crisis, unfettered intolerance, and growing economic inequalities? Can their work and efforts have a significant impact on the way society thinks and functions? How much responsibility does an artist bear? Is it enough to just ’spark a debate’ and hope other people will do the rest? </strong> </p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>
</br>

<p class="text">The ambition of the course is to help participants understand the mechanisms of activist art and provide an overview of the most inspiring and thought-provoking actions of politically-minded creative practioners. The sessions will also be designed to leave space for debates and reflection over contentious and ambiguous questions relevant to contemporary society.

<p class="text">Each week, the first half of the course will look at a particular political, cultural, technological or ethical theme that is the source of growing concern in society. Namely: the anthropocene, the persistence of colonialism, the rise of intelligent machines, the new forms of life engineered in laboratories. </p>

<p class="text">Each theme will be illustrated by artworks and public actions that have engaged successfully (and also not successfully because we can always learn from our mistakes) with the topic examined. These case studies will be mostly contemporary, with several incursions into historical precedents: anti-slavery activism in the 19th century, social upheaval in Ancient Greece, liberation struggles in the 60s and 70s, etc.</p>

<p class="text">The other half of the course will explore strategies, tools, and ideas to keep in mind no matter what the topic of the week will be. </p>


<p class="text">Each week, an assignment will invite participants to reflect on an ambiguous issue and to articulate an opinion based on their position or inability to take a clear position.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this course for?
</h4>

<p class="text">Politically-minded artists, designers and makers who believe that their ideas, concerns and beliefs should be heard outside of the usual white walls of cultural institutions. Activists looking for inventive strategies to get their message across. And pretty much anyone worried about the state of the world.
