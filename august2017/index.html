       <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>


      <p class="text">In this four-week class guided by artists and speculative designers Sascha Pohflepp and Chris Woebken, you will be designing experiences through use of live-action role play techniques (LARPing), computer vision, machine learning, and speculative prototyping.</p>

        <p class="text">We will provide a framework that revolves around a rapidly changing world that is bound to be increasingly populated by non-humans, both natural and artificial—such as advanced AI systems. Making their perspectives experienceable is going to be a key angle with a focus of designing for the new societies that will emerge.</p>

    <p class="text">The techniques will be diverse and collaborative exploration will be encouraged. A design for a specific community may be prototyped by crafting a narrative and using it as a laboratory in an iterative design process. More fictional challenges could be prototyped in a virtual environment that allows for a collaborative exploration of otherwise impossible spaces.</p>

    <p class="text">Key parts of the curriculum will be an introduction to a wide variety of simulation techniques across a wide variety of scales and media, including progressive live-action methods guided by artist and game designer Susan Ploetz, an introduction to speculative design methods and access to tools and working with digital fabrication technologies.</p>

    <p class="text">A second workshop with artificial intelligence specialist Gene Kogan will give participants an opportunity to create systems that may be informed by their insights they gained during the previous exercises. Field-trips to practitioners working with simulation tools,weekly readings and discussions around the subject aim to both supplement the learning experience, to provide inspiration and critical analysis.</p>


<p class="text">At the end of the class, those methods will have helped you to make great steps forward in your design process and you will have gained a whole new toolset within the scope of your practice. The final result will be a series of design provocations, shared and discussed in an event at ACUD which will be an exhibition as much an immersive experience.</p>
