  Throughout life, we’re often called upon to reimagine a better world or a different kind of future yet we’re given very few methods, models, or tools for doing so in constructive ways. “Our visions for the future are often colonized by mainstream imagery,” says Jim Dator, director of the Hawaii Research Center for Futures Studies. The flying cars and other tropes being served through Hollywood films only provide meagre forums for constructing alternative visions while the need for dealing with political uncertainty has rarely been greater.</p>


  <p class="text">Live-action scenarios have been used for a long time by groups as diverse as psychologists, think-tanks, civilian emergency management and the police and military for training and evaluation.  </p>

<p class="text">These simulation techniques can also successfully be adapted and augmented to serve as design prototyping tools, allowing artists and designers to investigate, experiment, propose, and test interactions and scenarios that unfold and iterate over time. </p>

<p class="text">  In our own work we translate those approaches into other forms, attempting to introduce them to audiences in more accessible ways with the ultimate goal of democratizing them.</p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">This course will use live-action role playing (LARPing) techniques, transforming them into prototyping tools for artists and designers that are as performative as they are productive, catering to a wide range of interests. </p>

    <p class="text">We will learn how to conceive and actualize future scenarios through a looped process of simulation and speculative prototyping, turning them into valuable tools that will allow us to investigate, experiment, and develop provocative ideas for engaging complex social, ecological, technological and ethical issues. </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/Speculative_Rocketry_1.jpg" class="pic">

      <p class="text">Participants will learn how to conceive and actualize future scenarios, while gaining an understanding of fabrication processes in order to create objects to enhance the believability of our created world. </p> 

        <p class="text">Key parts of the curriculum will be an introduction to live-action methods such as progressive LARPing by an experienced game-writer, an introduction to speculative design methods, a field-trip to a simulation site, lectures by researchers, rapid fabrication techniques and weekly readings.</p>

    <p class="text">Together, this will allow us to conceptualize, and prototype alternatives in a live-action setting with the ultimate goal of produce and document a range of concrete design proposals, both technological and not. The final result will be a series of gestures in a joint scenario which at the end of the workshop will be shared and discussed in an exhibition and immersive experience.</p>
