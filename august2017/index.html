       <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

<p class="text">This course will use live-action role playing (LARPing) techniques, transforming them into prototyping tools for artists and designers that are as performative as they are productive, catering to a wide range of interests.  </p>

    <p class="text">We will learn how to conceive and actualize future scenarios through a looped process of simulation and speculative prototyping, turning them into valuable tools that will allow us to investigate, experiment, and develop provocative ideas for engaging complex social, ecological, technological and ethical issues. </p>



      <p class="text">Participants will learn how to conceive and actualize future scenarios, while gaining an understanding of fabrication processes in order to create objects to enhance the believability of our created world. </p> 

        <p class="text">Key parts of the curriculum will be an introduction to live-action methods such as progressive LARPing by an experienced game-writer, an introduction to speculative design methods, a field-trip to a simulation site, lectures by researchers, rapid fabrication techniques and weekly readings.</p>

    <p class="text">Together, this will allow us to conceptualize, and prototype alternatives in a live-action setting with the ultimate goal of produce and document a range of concrete design proposals, both technological and not. The final result will be a series of gestures in a joint scenario which at the end of the workshop will be shared and discussed in an exhibition and immersive experience.</p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >The House in the Sky</strong> The House in the Sky is an installation of anaglyph stereoscopic projections by Sascha Pohflepp and Chris Woebken that re-create the mid-century Los Angeles home of think-tank strategists Alfred and Roberta Wohlstetter. There—at the height of the Cold War—possible futures were presumably discussed along with the end of the world. Modeled on photographs of the residence taken by Julius Shulman and Leonard McCombe, the videos re-stage these interdisciplinary meetings, aiming to investigate relationships between architecture and critical inquiry, technological acceleration, and our place within history.
