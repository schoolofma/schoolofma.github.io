			<p>School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe brings together artists working with technology andhackers working with art, in an intensive, selfdirected summer learning program to creatively explore their craft in-depth within a community of likeminded curious thinkers and makers!</p>
			<p>Summer 2014, School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe will run two one-month full-time programs, for 10-15 students each.</p>
			<p>July 2014 will be focused on Making+Motors: Fabrication & Making Things Move.</p>
			<p>Our August 2014 program will focus on creative coding, interactive public installation and projection-mapping.</p>
			<p>Classes will be a mix of lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, hackers and educators. Students will also have opportunities to share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops.</p>
			<p>We are currently looking for a space in w hich to run the program Summer 2014 - one that could house 20 people at a time - for two months, fulltime, July and August.</p>
			<p>Ideally, we would love to find a space which itself has roots within the global art and technology scene. Weâ€™re interested in forming mutually beneficial, long-term, collaborative relationships with established communities!</p>
