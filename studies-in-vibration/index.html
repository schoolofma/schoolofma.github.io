<p class="text">All elements of our world are composed of vibrating particles that pass through time and space. By exploring the different ways in which we experience vibration, paying particular attention to sound, light, and visuals, we'll be able to more effectively understand the web of relationships that together form our perception of the universe through our bodies, minds, and tools. </p>

  <p class="text">In this program we'll learn the fundamentals of how vibrations (energy) move through space by working with visual and experimental sound artists to navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience. We'll also work with theoretical physicists to understand the fundamentals of vibrations, and how they influence every element of the world we live in.</p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

<p class="text">During this four-week program we will explore the notion of vibration from both the scientific and creative perspectives. Each week a group of scientists and artists will host a workshop that will highlight a different element of vibration. Working together, they will discuss the mechanical properties—how these aspects of vibration actually work and what their effects are— which will be matched with demonstrations of how these properties can be manifested creatively, primarily through light and sound. </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/FT_01.jpg" class="pic">

  <p class="text">We will start the course with the fundamentals, with things like string theory, harmonic oscillators, how sound and light waves are created and perceived by the mind/body. Working essentially from micro to macro, concrete to conceptual, we will then discuss notions of observational atmospheric oscillations: gravitational waves and seismic oscillations, illustrated with a more psychological relationship between movement and place/how we perceive the spaces around us. </p>

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/FT_02.jpg" class="pic">

  <p class="text">We will end with conversations related to theoretical physics: the relationship between space and time, and how these concepts are explored visually and aurally. The final week will be focused on hands-on working time where students will be able to refine and realize their works, which will be featured in a one-night exhibition on the final night of the course.</p>





<h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This course is designed for anyone who has an interest in understanding how the world works from a functional, fundamental, scientific perspective, how these forces impact us on a day-to-day level, and then how to translate this into creative energies through light and sound. </p>

  <p class="text">You don’t have to have a background in physics to participate in this workshop. We have built-in the time to have introductory lectures which will open-up into group discussions through out the weeks. </p>

  <p class="text">We will begin at a basic popular science level and will advance along with the requirements of the group. This workshop is designed for people who are interested in making connections between the seen and unseen forces at play in our universe.</p>

<h4 class="title">What will we learn?
</h4>

<p class="text">We will begin with the general topic of vibration (its forms and mechanisms) and then as we build a fundamental understanding we will engage the topic from a more conceptual perspective, exploring it through light and sound, gravitational waves, time, and space. Each weeks’ topic will be introduced by a physicist or astrophysicist and then will be complimented by a visual or sound artist. </p>

<p class="text">We will learn how to channel our conceptual ideas into realities (either through physical, digital, or auditory artworks), how to explore light and sound through architecture and the landscapes that we exist within, and how to observe and connect the myriad forces at play in our worlds.</p>

After obtaining a Masters Degree in Design at The Glasgow School of Art, she began developing installations, working in a variety of disparate environments and tailoring each project to fit the space. To worked in textiles and as a tailor for 4 years assisting with embroidery and pattern cutting for designers such as Alexander McQueen and Boudicca, her attention to detail remains apparent in her aesthetics, with a strong focus on interior, textures and composition.</p>

            <p class="text">To has a background in classical music which led her to collaborate with sound designers for commissioned projects and performances including The Society of Arts and Technology in Montreal, Budapest institute 4DSOUND and Unsound Festival in Krakow. She continues to explore the effects of live performance, through researching the creation of physical presence with light and how different sensory arrangements can create an emotional and psychological impact on the audience.</p>

            <p class="text">In 2006 the artist graduated from the Sculpture Transplantation Studio, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Poznan, defending her doctorial dissertation at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw.  Following her project titled “Making the walls quake as if they were dilating with the secret knowledge of great powers”, Krakowiak received special mention at the 2012 edition of the Venice Architecture Biennale.

            <p class="text">Among other projects, Krakowiak is the author of the “Radio all.FM” project that was carried out in several cities all over the world (e.g. Tel Awiv, Tallinn, Mexico City, Wroclaw), in which she used a radio transmitter to “borrow” frequencies from various radio stations and then to broadcast through a hidden transmitter to completely unaware recipients. Her works have been presented at numerous solo exhibitions and internationally.</p>

            <p class="text">About the course, Bejger says: Gravitational waves are vibrations of the fabric of space-time
itself. Their influence on the world that surrounds us manifests itself
in changes of distances between objects and in varying paces of
the flow of time. They are produced by rapidly moving, massive
bodies like black holes, and once emitted they travel through the
Cosmos with the speed of light. I will talk about their features,
their differences and similarities to the electromagnetic waves
(a.k.a. the light) and about what is actually needed to sense
and study them.</p>
