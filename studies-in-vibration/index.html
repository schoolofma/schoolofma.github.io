<strong style="font-weight: bold;" >VIBRATION vi bra tion  /vʌɪˈbreɪʃ(ə)n/  (Oxford Dictionaries online):</strong>
An instance of vibrating
1.1 Physics An oscillation of the parts of a fluid or an elastic solid whose equilibrium has been disturbed or of an electromagnetic wave
2 (vibrations) informal A person’s emotional state, the atmosphere of a place, or the associations of an object, as communicated to and felt by others</p>

<p class="text">All elements of our world are composed of vibrating particles that pass through time and space. By exploring the different ways in which we experience vibration, we will be able to more effectively understand the web of relationships that together form the whole of our universe through our bodies, minds, and tools. </p>

  <p class="text">In this program we'll learn the fundamentals of how vibrations (energy) move through space by working with visual and experimental sound artists to navigate the world of vibration as a sensory experience. We'll also work with theoretical physicists to understand the fundamentals of vibrations, and how they influence every element of the world we live in.</p>

            <p class="text">Paul is an artist and audio-visual performer working with generative video environments and acousmatic sound. His work, which has been shown and performed internationally, focuses on the ways in which sound, space and form can be cross-wired to create live-cinematic visual-music experiences.</p>
        

            <p class="text">Paul is a contributing writer to both Holo and Neural, printed magazines that explore the intersections of media art, electronic culture and computational creativity. He also maintains the weblog Dataisnature exploring the interrelationships between natural processes, computational systems and procedural-based art practices.</p>
