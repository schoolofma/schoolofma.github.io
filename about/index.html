		<p>The School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe was founded in Summer 2014 as brainchild of Rachel Uwa.</p>
		<p> After many years of attending workshops that took place over a day or a weekend, Rachel realised that if you really want to learn something new, full-immersion is key.  </p>

						<p class="title">The School of Machines is a playground, bootcamp, community center, and lucid dream in equal parts. The mix of giving students, brilliant instructors with giant hearts, and visionary and thoughtful leadership made this exactly the art/tech education experience I've been trying to find for a long time.</p

						<p class="title">Learning with a bunch of creative and skilled misfits couldn't have been more fun. The school took us from zero to sixty in one month, starting at the basics and ending with a public show of collaborative work. I understand the world of digital art in a deeper and practical way now. I'm proud to have been so immersed in Berlin culture with such a productive outcome.</p

						<p class="title">I learnt so many things that cannot be summarized in a paragraph. But most importantly I learnt to appreciate art, how to use it as medium to change the way people think, inspire others and as a way to express yourself. Also how technology can assist us to express the artistic and creative views of a non-artist like me. </p
