		<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >School of Machines, Making & Make Believe is a uniquely curated School born in Berlin, Germany in 2014, keen on inventing one-of-a-kind hands-on learning experiences in the areas of art, technology, design, and human connection. We embrace art, creativity and exploring the latest technology and ourselves with openness and curiosity.</strong></p>

<p>In bringing together an ever-changing constellation of talented instructors, themselves distinguished artists, designers, makers and other professionals from around the globe, and providing a space where imaginations can run wild, our students come to us ready to expose their creative innards to the world in their own unique ways as they learn to work with new tools and people who can help make it happen.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/school005.jpg" class="pic"></p>

<p>We teach tangible skills like how to code, work with electronics, and use digital fabrication tools while exploring concepts, narrative and play. Our goal is to help people take the fantastical ideas inside their heads out into the physical realm to further their artistic practice or to help wrestle out the confidence to begin one. We teach technology to artists and design, creativity, and art to the technology community.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/school007.jpg" class="pic"></p>

<p>Since 2014, we've run several programs on a variety of topics including: responsive spaces, physical computing, data visualisation, connected devices and design fiction, connecting human emotions and outerspace, computer vision, machine learning for artists, virtual reality and 360 filmmaking.</p>

<p>We’ve got more exciting programs in the works, but it’s important to note that each course is a unique moment in time. Themes, instructors, duration and even the country in which programs will run, will change. We’re striving to keep it interesting. Stay tuned!</p>

          <p class="text">Zola Zakiya is a writer, performance artist, arts and cultural organizer who wandered into Berlin two years ago on a whim. Growing up in Texas, she attended the Arts Magnet high school in Dallas where she developed the desire to break away from the norm and follow her path to New York. After living in NYC, providing therapy and managing arts programs for under served youth, she decided to live her own life more creatively and focused on writing in Amsterdam.</p> 

          <p class="text">Now in Berlin, she collaborates on multi-media performance art that includes movement, sound, and visuals. Working with the School of Machines as a Program Consultant inspires her to find ways that technology and art can best work together, a great parallel to living a life of innovation.</p>
