		<p>School of Machines, Making & Make Believe is a uniquely curated School born in Berlin, Germany in 2014, keen on inventing one-of-a-kind hands-on learning experiences in the field of Art, Technology and Design. We embrace art, creativity and exploring the latest technology and ourselves with humility and curiosity.</p> 

<p>In bringing together an ever-changing constellation of talented instructors, themselves distinguished artists, designers, makers and other professionals from around the globe, and providing a space where imaginations can run wild, our students come to us ready to expose their creative innards to the world in their own unique ways as they learn to work with new tools and people who can help make it happen. </p>

<p>We teach tangible skills like how to code, work with electronics and use digital fabrication tools while exploring concepts, narrative and play. Our goal is to help people take the fantastical ideas inside their heads out into the physical realm to further their artistic practice or to help wrestle out the confidence to begin one. We teach tech skills to artists and design, creativity, and art to the tech community.</p>

<p>In 2014, we ran two month-long full-time programs focusing on Responsive Spaces and Physical Computing in Berlin. </p>

<p><p>Happening directly after Belgrade's beloved <a heref"http://resonate.io/2015/" target="_blank">Resonate Festival</a>, from April 20th-May 22nd, 2015, with a unique mix of talents hailing from the RCA in London and ITP in NY as well as international artists and researchers, we’ll see our next adventure take us further east to Belgrade, Serbia, where our program will focus on Empathy and Culture in the context of Digital Fabrication and speculative and critical design.  Students can expect to engage their science fiction fantasies, their digital fabrication know-how, and even their souls*! And yes, mountains, we will visit the mountains!</p>

<p>We’ve got more programs in the works, but it’s important to note that each course is a unique moment in time. Themes, instructors, duration and even the country in which programs will run, will change. We’re striving to keep it interesting. Stay tuned!</p>

						<p class="title">The School of Machines is a playground, bootcamp, community center, and lucid dream in equal parts. The mix of giving students, brilliant instructors with giant hearts, and visionary and thoughtful leadership made this exactly the art/tech education experience I've been trying to find for a long time.</p

						<p class="title">Learning with a bunch of creative and skilled misfits couldn't have been more fun. The school took us from zero to sixty in one month, starting at the basics and ending with a public show of collaborative work. I understand the world of digital art in a deeper and practical way now. I'm proud to have been so immersed in Berlin culture with such a productive outcome.</p

						<p class="title">I learnt so many things that cannot be summarized in a paragraph. But most importantly I learnt to appreciate art, how to use it as medium to change the way people think, inspire others and as a way to express yourself. Also how technology can assist us to express the artistic and creative views of a non-artist like me. </p
