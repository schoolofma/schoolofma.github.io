		<h3 class="title ">About The School</h3>
		<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >School of Machines, Making & Make Believe is a uniquely curated School born in Berlin, Germany in 2014, keen on inventing one-of-a-kind hands-on learning experiences in the field of Art, Technology and Design. We embrace art, creativity and exploring the latest technology and ourselves with humility and curiosity.</strong></p> 

<p>In bringing together an ever-changing constellation of talented instructors, themselves distinguished artists, designers, makers and other professionals from around the globe, and providing a space where imaginations can run wild, our students come to us ready to expose their creative innards to the world in their own unique ways as they learn to work with new tools and people who can help make it happen.</p>

<p>We teach tangible skills like how to code, work with electronics and use digital fabrication tools while exploring concepts, narrative and play. Our goal is to help people take the fantastical ideas inside their heads out into the physical realm to further their artistic practice or to help wrestle out the confidence to begin one. We teach technology to artists and design, creativity, and art to the technology community.</p>

<p>In 2014, we ran two month-long full-time programs focusing on Responsive Spaces and Physical Computing in Berlin. Currently, we're running a ten-week summer program called Interventions focusing on art, technology and social activism. <strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Applications for our upcoming program Fabricating Empathy: Art, Technology, and Outer Space are currently open.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve got more programs in the works, but it’s important to note that each course is a unique moment in time. Themes, instructors, duration and even the country in which programs will run, will change. We’re striving to keep it interesting. Stay tuned!</p>

		<h3 class="title ">About the Founder</h3>

		<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe was founded by Rachel Uwa</strong>. Rachel is an artist and organiser whose background is in audio engineering and vfx compositing. Over the past 15+ years she’s lived in and organized social justice and tech communities and events big and small. Some of the highlights: Stone Soup Cooperative Chicago, Food Not Bombs, OpenTechSchool, Hackership and School of MA. She feels compelled to help bring these two worlds together and make the tech world less daunting and more diverse, inclusive, thoughtful and fun.</p> <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Rachel's biggest desire is to see people living the lives they dream of living rather than the one they feel they ought to.</strong> If that dream life is more artistic, creative, socially-engaged, technology-embracing and connects humans to each other and to themselves, well, all the better.</p>
