		<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >School of Machines, Making & Make Believe is a uniquely curated School born in Berlin, Germany in 2014, keen on inventing one-of-a-kind hands-on learning experiences in the areas of art, technology, design, and human connection. We embrace art, creativity and exploring the latest technology and ourselves with openness, humility, and curiosity.</strong></p>

<p>In bringing together an ever-changing constellation of talented instructors, themselves distinguished artists, designers, makers and other professionals from around the globe, and providing a space where imaginations can run wild, our students come to us ready to expose their creative innards to the world in their own unique ways as they learn to work with new tools and people who can help make it happen.</p>

<p><img src="http://schoolofma.org/i/school005.jpg" class="pic"></p>

<p>We teach tangible skills like how to code, work with electronics, and use digital fabrication tools while exploring concepts, narrative and play. Our goal is to help people take the fantastical ideas inside their heads out into the physical realm to further their artistic practice or to help wrestle out the confidence to begin one. We teach technology to artists and design, creativity, and art to the technology community.</p>

<p><img src="http://schoolofma.org/i/school007.jpg" class="pic"></p>

<p>Since 2014, we've run several programs on a variety of topics including: responsive spaces, physical computing, data visualisation, connected devices and design fiction, connecting human emotions and outerspace, computer vision, machine learning for artists, virtual reality and 360 filmmaking.</p>

<p><img src="http://schoolofma.org/i/school002.jpg" class="pic"></p>

<p>We’ve got more exciting programs in the works, but it’s important to note that each course is a unique moment in time. Themes, instructors, duration and even the country in which programs will run, will change. We’re striving to keep it interesting. Stay tuned!</p>

          <p class="text">Zola Zakiya is a writer, performance artist, arts and cultural organizer who wandered into Berlin two years ago on a whim. Growing up in Texas, she attended the Arts Magnet high school in Dallas where she developed the desire to break away from the norm and follow her path to New York. After living in NYC, providing therapy and managing arts programs for under served youth, she decided to live her own life more creatively and focused on writing in Amsterdam.</p> 

          <p class="text">Now in Berlin, she collaborates on multi-media performance art that includes movement, sound, and visuals. Working with the School of Machines as a Program Consultant inspires her to find ways that art and technology can best inspire each other while connecting with other progressive minds in this spectrum.</p>

          <p class="text">After forging his programming and design skills in traditional software and game development, Christian decided that it is time to leave the business and entertainment swamp and jump into the colorful pool that is interactive art.

He recently moved to Berlin to find fertile soil and collaboration partners for putting thought into action.</p>

		<p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe was founded by Rachel Uwa</strong>. Rachel is an artist, educator, and organiser whose background is in audio engineering and vfx compositing. </p>

		<p>Over the past 15+ years she’s lived in and organized social justice and tech communities and events big and small. She feels compelled to help bring these two worlds together and make the tech world less daunting and more diverse, inclusive, thoughtful, and fun.</p> <p><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Rachel's biggest desire is to see people living the lives they dream of living rather than the one they feel they ought to.</strong> If that dream life is more artistic, creative, socially-engaged, technology-embracing and connects humans to each other and to themselves, well, all the better.</p>
