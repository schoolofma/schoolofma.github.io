      <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>



    <p class="text">Corporeal is an intensive four-week program led by artists Florence To and Antoine Bertin.</p> 

      <p class="text">Combining elements of spatial recording, virtual reality sound design and audio installation practices, participants are invited to develop an immersive experience using the Monom sound system.</p> 
    

    <p class="text">Leading an exploration of materials, form, human body, binaural recordings, interactive audio, and listening practices, participants are taken on a journey to reveal new and unexpected sensations.</p>



      <p class="text">Our listening reality is intimate, tactile, spatial, social and temporal. Using creative, analogue and digital means of bending the sense of hearing, students are invited to explore the idea of a sound-driven virtual reality. Listening through the ear and vibrations through the body, the group will devise original strategies of blurring the boundary between the virtual and the real.</p>

      <p class="text">Surveying the techniques, applications and future directions of sound; as stories and design possibilities within the format of spatial sculptures and architectural environments, will investigate further into psychoacoustics and creative learning with physical objects. </p>


      <p class="text">This workshop will take you from the intricacies of the ear to the surface of the skin, learning within resonant spaces and journey through the new possibilities in sound experience design that have emerged through the boom of virtual reality. Learning to design sound composition through storytelling not only through digital but within intuitive crafts to create an individual learning and listening process throughout the workshop. </p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Noqturnl</strong> is an overnight performance exploring the threshold between waking and dreaming. NOQTURNL art director Florence To and composer John Connell share a deep interest in the way technology and media can alter perception ­ affecting the formation of our personal and social constructs, both positively and adversely. They have been collaborating with spatial sound collective 4DSOUND since 2014 to explore how spatial audio­visual technologies can encourage constructive environments for self­-reflection, creative ideation and social interaction.</p>
