          <p class="text">This program is about money! Whether we have it or not, money rules the world, or so it seems. In recent years, technologies like crypotocurrency, bitcoin, and blockchain have come to the fore ofering alternatives to the current system but we need to know more! What’s the history of economies and money, what are the current financial systems that plague us, how does money laundering and tax evasion work, how might we create new systems and alternatives that can help bring about justice and level the playing field?</p>
