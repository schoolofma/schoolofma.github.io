        <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>


          <p class="text">This program is about money! Whether we have it or not, money rules the world, or so it seems. In recent years, technologies like crypotocurrency, bitcoin, and blockchain have come to the fore ofering alternatives to the current system but we need to know more! What’s the history of economies and money, what are the current financial systems that plague us, how does money laundering and tax evasion work, how might we create new systems and alternatives that can help bring about justice and level the playing field? This program is an attempt to create a progressive curriculum for financial literacy, for everyone!</p>
    

          <p class="text">Together we'll talk about the myths and realities of socio-cultural patterns such as barter, value exchange systems, gift economies and the peculiar relation of money & moral. We'll also trace the history of money and credit and understand their associations with societal changes while exploring different notions of value creation and value accounting in societies worldwide.</p>

          <p class="text">Taking the recent financial crisis 2007-2008 as a starting point for the rise of a finance-counterculture, we'll look at: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the notion of platform cooperativism (as opposed to platform capitalism), and the rise of horizontal organizational structures where collective financial decisionmaking is emerging as a new norm and the idea of re-inventing the commons as a way for creating livelihood for everybody.</p>
 
          <p class="text">The class will include playful experiments in financial co-creation: we will work on concepts and prototypes for basic income, token systems, and community currencies.</p>

          <p class="text">This class aims at providing a solid understanding of money and finance, in relation to different political and social systems. Students will learn about the emergence of markets, credit, debt, and corruption as we seek to stimulate everyone’s imagination of how a fair, inclusive economy might become a reality.</p>
