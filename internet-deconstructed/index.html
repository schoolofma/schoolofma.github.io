<h5 class="title">How It Works</h5>
       <p class="text">Welcome to our online courses! Soon we will create an FAQ for these programs. For now, it's important to note that these online classes will be taking place over the course of four weeks, for two hours each week. </p>

       <p class="text">Classes are live meaning that you can directly interact with the instructor as well as the other participants. Classes will also be recorded for playback in case you are unable to attend for any reason. More info coming soon! For specific questions, please email info[at]schoolofma.org</p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4></br>

    <p class="text">Most of our life transactions are mediated by interfaces. Nevertheless, far from being neutral entities, interfaces exercise a great deal of power over its users, representing one of the major anti-democratic governance entities in our society. In this program we will look into the ways interfaces are affecting us as a global society and will collectively think on ways to democratize them. Interfaces for the people! </p>

<p class="text">This program seeks to critically reveal, analyze, and connect the complex  network of agents that converge on the configuration of the Graphic User  Interface (GUI). During this four week course we will creatively reveal,  deconstruct, and re-articulate the material and immaterial elements that  make up the GUI in order to reflect on its role and influence within  the social, political, economic, cultural and emotional spheres of the  networked society. </p>

<p class="text">The main purpose of the program is to  provide students with the theoretical background on UI design along with technical skills, such as basic HTML and CSS, to explore, develop and  test disruptive methodologies as we strive to incorporate democratic values within  Interfaces.</p>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this course for?
</h4>

<p class="text">
This program is for artists, designers, writers, makers, coders, journalists and researchers interested in understanding, exploring, and disrupting networks and interfaces. We will also investigate the underlying intentions of user interfaces, and how UI designs demonstrate the latent political, socioeconomic, emotional, and cultural opinions of their designers from both a theoretical and hands-on perspective.</p>

<p class="text">During the program we will reveal
the underlying narratives embedded in everyday interfaces,
such as Facebook and Google, in order to reveal to what extent they
sculpt and govern our realities in silent ways.</p>

<h4 class="title">Course Outline</h4>

<p class="text"><h5>Week 1</h5> 
<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Beyond the Interface I: Internet infrastructures, Data flows & Geopolitics.  </strong> During this week we will reveal the main infrastructures and actors (companies and agencies) that configure the Internet and will explore how the data is traveling across the world.</p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">
Keywords:</strong>  internet backbone, data forensics, net neutrality, internet geopolitics.
</p>

<h5>Week 2</h5>
<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Beyond the Interface II: Online surveillance and commodification of Data.  </strong> In this session we will show how the data that we generate through interfaces is being tracked, harvested and commodified. We will look into the methodologies and tools used by many corporations and agencies that silently access and use the information we produce in daily basis. </p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">
Keywords:</strong> online tracking, data brokers, profiling.
</p>

<h5>Week 3</h5>
<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >Interface materiality: The environmental impact of code. </strong> During this session we will learn how code is constructing web interfaces. We will look closely to HTML and CSS and explain how this languages work. At the same time, we will look into the environmental impact of interfaces in order to understand how its footprint could be dramatically reduced through code.</p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">
Keywords:</strong> code & ideology, HTML, CSS, data & CO2, sustainability.
</p>

<h5>Week 4</h5>
<p class="text">In the last week of the program we will discuss how graphic interface design is homogenizing behavior in a global a scale and the several consequences of this process. On the other hand we will experiment with simple disruptive methodologies to intervene the interface design of the most used websites globally in order to subvert such cultural homogenization.</p>
<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;">
Keywords: </strong>interface governance, corporative design, community design, CSS, HTML.
