		<p>Classes will be a mix of lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, hackers and educators, as well as abundant time for self-directed, hands-on learning. Students will also have opportunities to share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops. In addition, we will organise weekly artist-talks/discussion groups for participants with invited guest speakers.</p>

						<h5 class="name">S. Astrid Bin <span class="sub web">/ <a href="http://www.astridbin.com/">www.astridbin.com</a></span></h5>
						<p class="text">S. Astrid Bin&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;interdisciplinary artist, designer and&nbsp;creative technologist. Her&nbsp;work examines the&nbsp;poetry in&nbsp;everyday things and&nbsp;the connections between people and&nbsp;their environments, and&nbsp;blurs, skips over and&nbsp;stamps on&nbsp;the&nbsp;line between art&nbsp;and&nbsp;design practice. She&nbsp;also folds technology into the&nbsp;fabric of&nbsp;the&nbsp;work she&nbsp;makes. She works two&nbsp;dimensionally (works on&nbsp;paper, text pieces, photography, printed projects, interfaces), three dimensionally (installation, art&nbsp;in&nbsp;public spaces, and&nbsp;reactive objects), and&nbsp;four dimensionally (sound, video, performance and&nbsp;interactive works). As&nbsp;an&nbsp;art&nbsp;and&nbsp;technology researcher, she applies an&nbsp;art-based approach to&nbsp;design and&nbsp;engineering problems spanning interfaces, public space, new&nbsp;uses for&nbsp;games, the&nbsp;role of&nbsp;fun in&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;use, and re-imagining the&nbsp;music performing and&nbsp;listening experience.</p>
						<p class="text">She&nbsp;has exhibited in&nbsp;Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Germany, and is&nbsp;currently pursuing a&nbsp;doctorate in&nbsp;media and&nbsp;art&nbsp;technology at&nbsp;Queen Mary, University of&nbsp;London.</p>

						<h5 class="name">Peter "Pure" Votava </h5>
						<p class="text">Peter Votava produces and&nbsp;performs electronic music under his&nbsp;moniker Pure since beginning of&nbsp;the&nbsp;90s. Since 1998 he&nbsp;uses the&nbsp;programming environment Max&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;important tool in&nbsp;his&nbsp;artistic work.</p>
						<p class="text">He&nbsp;co-developed the&nbsp;Heart Chamber Orchestra for&nbsp;12&nbsp;classical trained musicians. Using their heartbeats, the&nbsp;musicians control a&nbsp;computer composition and&nbsp;visualization environment. They read and&nbsp;play a&nbsp;real-time score from laptop screens placed in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;them.</p>
						<p class="text">In&nbsp;various collaborations like Prszr and&nbsp;Bolder he&nbsp;combines his&nbsp;passion for&nbsp;the&nbsp;gloomier sides of&nbsp;music with his&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;audio software programming for&nbsp;computer based live performances using a&nbsp;mix&nbsp;of&nbsp;electro-acoustic composition, sound synthesis, and&nbsp;live electronics.</p>
						<p class="text">He&nbsp;holds a&nbsp;Master's Degree in&nbsp;Computer Music.</p>
