		<p>Classes will be a mix of lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, technologists and educators, as well as abundant time for self-directed, hands-on learning. Students will also have opportunities to share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops. In addition, we will organise weekly artist-talks/discussion groups for participants with invited guest speakers.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Exploring Interactive Stories <span class="sub warning">/ July 2014</span></h3>
			
			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories with code? This course will focus on creative coding and interactivity in the context of responsive spaces. The goal is to explore the creative and expressive possibilities of new technologies and digital tools while gaining a foundation in creative coding (algorithmic animation, computer vision, audio analysis, projection mapping, networks, and 3D graphics). We will work mainly with OpenFrameworks and Processing, but may also incorporate other  platforms. Teachers and students will work together towards the production of individual or group projects and will have access to the equipment needed to create functioning responsive installations. Expect to play with code, be experimental and have fun!

						<p class="text">S. Astrid Bin&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;interdisciplinary artist, designer and&nbsp;creative technologist. Her&nbsp;work examines the&nbsp;poetry in&nbsp;everyday things and&nbsp;the connections between people and&nbsp;their environments, and&nbsp;blurs, skips over and&nbsp;stamps on&nbsp;the&nbsp;line between art&nbsp;and&nbsp;design practice. She&nbsp;also folds technology into the&nbsp;fabric of&nbsp;the&nbsp;work she&nbsp;makes. She works two&nbsp;dimensionally (works on&nbsp;paper, text pieces, photography, printed projects, interfaces), three dimensionally (installation, art&nbsp;in&nbsp;public spaces, and&nbsp;reactive objects), and&nbsp;four dimensionally (sound, video, performance and&nbsp;interactive works). As&nbsp;an&nbsp;art&nbsp;and&nbsp;technology researcher, she applies an&nbsp;art-based approach to&nbsp;design and&nbsp;engineering problems spanning interfaces, public space, new&nbsp;uses for&nbsp;games, the&nbsp;role of&nbsp;fun in&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;use, and re-imagining the&nbsp;music performing and&nbsp;listening experience.</p>
						<p class="text">She&nbsp;has exhibited in&nbsp;Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Germany, and is&nbsp;currently pursuing a&nbsp;doctorate in&nbsp;media and&nbsp;art&nbsp;technology at&nbsp;Queen Mary, University of&nbsp;London.</p>

						<p class="text">He&nbsp;co-developed the&nbsp;Heart Chamber Orchestra for&nbsp;12&nbsp;classical trained musicians. Using their heartbeats, the&nbsp;musicians control a&nbsp;computer composition and&nbsp;visualization environment. They read and&nbsp;play a&nbsp;real-time score from laptop screens placed in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;them.</p>
						<p class="text">In&nbsp;various collaborations like Prszr and&nbsp;Bolder he&nbsp;combines his&nbsp;passion for&nbsp;the&nbsp;gloomier sides of&nbsp;music with his&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;audio software programming for&nbsp;computer based live performances using a&nbsp;mix&nbsp;of&nbsp;electro-acoustic composition, sound synthesis, and&nbsp;live electronics.</p>
