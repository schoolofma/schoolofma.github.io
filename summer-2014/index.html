		<p>Classes will be a mix of lectures, workshops, labs and experiments with well-known artists, technologists and educators, as well as abundant time for self-directed, hands-on learning. Students will also have opportunities to share their knowledge with each other through student-led workshops. In addition, we will organise weekly artist-talks/discussion groups for participants with invited guest speakers.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Responsive Spaces <span class="sub warning">/ July 2014</span></h3>
			
			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories with code? This course will focus on creative coding and interactivity in the context of responsive spaces. The goal is to explore the creative and expressive possibilities of new technologies and digital tools while gaining a foundation in creative coding (algorithmic animation, computer vision, audio analysis, projection mapping, networks, and 3D graphics).</p>
			<p>We will work mainly with OpenFrameworks and Processing, but may also incorporate other  platforms. Teachers and students will work together towards the production of individual or group projects and will have access to the equipment needed to create functioning responsive installations. Expect to play with code, be experimental and have fun!</p>

Her&nbsp;work examines the&nbsp;poetry in&nbsp;everyday things and&nbsp;the connections between people and&nbsp;their environments. She&nbsp;also folds technology into the&nbsp;fabric of&nbsp;the&nbsp;work she&nbsp;makes. She works two&nbsp;dimensionally (works on&nbsp;paper, text pieces, photography, printed projects, interfaces), three dimensionally (installation, art&nbsp;in&nbsp;public spaces, and&nbsp;reactive objects), and&nbsp;four dimensionally (sound, video, performance and&nbsp;interactive works). As&nbsp;an&nbsp;art&nbsp;and&nbsp;technology researcher, she applies an&nbsp;art-based approach to&nbsp;design and&nbsp;engineering problems spanning interfaces, public space, new&nbsp;uses for&nbsp;games, the&nbsp;role of&nbsp;fun in&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;use, and re-imagining the&nbsp;music performing and&nbsp;listening experience.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Let's Get Physical<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjRA0vCV8iw" target="_blank">!</a> <span class="sub warning">/ August 2014</span></h3>
			<p>How can we create meaningful interactive experiences or tell stories by making things move?  This course will focus on physical computing and interactivity, exploring the creative intersection of new technologies, digital fabrication (3D printing, laser-cutting) and how they can work seemlessly together to help you express yourself artistically in both purposeful and non-sensical ways.</p>
			<p>Teachers and students will take a hands-on approach to working with basic electronic components, sensors and motors as well as with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, learning to use these tools to play, and to create magical things that move! </p>
