  	<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >\\ For Immediate Release. 15 March, 2016. Berlin, Germany </br>School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe</strong> </p>

<p class="text">School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe has just announced an open call for applications for their four-week creative technology programs taking place from June-August 2016 in Berlin, Germany.  In it’s third year, and based in ACUD MACHT NEU, this year’s summer programs include critical topics such as Computer Vision, Machine Learning for Artists, and Virtual Reality. Leading figures in the fields of new-media art and technology will unite in Berlin to lead the full-time programs, which have in the past drawn attendees from as far away as Brazil, Mexico, India and the US, as well as from various countries throughout Europe.</p>

<p class="text">At the close of each four-week intensive program, an exhibition highlighting the projects completed by program participants will follow.</p>

<p class="text">Aside from course instruction, programs include guest artist talks, studio visits, and bike-riding excursions during which projects are projected onto buildings throughout the streets of Berlin with Graffiti Research Lab Germany as interventionist/collaborator.</p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >ABOUT School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe</strong></br>Founded as an independent school in Berlin, Germany in 2014, School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe is an organisation dedicated to the imaginative exploration of art, technology, design, and human connection. The school runs several intensive four-week programs throughout the year, each uniquely curated in both topic and instructors. In 2016, the school has begun to organise programs outside of Berlin, most recently in Turin, Italy, at Casa Jasmina, the connected home of the future. </p>

<p class="text"><strong style="font-weight: bold;" >ABOUT the Founder</strong></br>School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe was founded by Rachel Uwa, an american artist and organiser who has previously worked in the fields of audio technology and visual effects compositing. Knowing the complexities of learning new technologies, she feels compelled to help others through this process, making the tech world less daunting and more diverse, inclusive, thoughtful, and fun. </p>

<p class="text">Rachel's biggest desire is to see people living the lives they dream of living rather than the one they feel they ought to. If that dream life is more artistic, creative, socially-engaged, technology-embracing and connects humans to each other and to themselves, well, all the better.</p>
