 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">Augmented Ear Reality is a workshop lead by sound artist Antoine Bertin and visual artist Helene Combal-Weiss. They meet in the design practice of sensorial experiences. Their hybrid creations merge auditory and tactile senses in the completion of objects, installation and participative experiments.</p> 

    

    <p class="text">Leading an exploration of materials, shapes, human body, binaural recordings, interactive audio, and listening practices, participants are taken on a journey to reveal new and unexpected sensations. </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}i/AER_1.jpg" class="pic">

      <p class="text">Our listening reality is intimate, tactile, spatial, social and temporal. Using creative, analog and digital means of bending the sense of hearing, students are invited to explore the idea of a sound-driven virtual reality. Listening through the ear, listening through skin, listening through bones: through the creation of ‘ear accessories’, the group will devise original strategies of blurring the boundary between the virtual and the real.</p>

</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward artists, designers, musicians, and anyone interested in experimenting with tactile materials, and the possibilities of storytelling with perception and 3D sound.</p>

 <h4 class="title">Course Description
</h4>

    <p class="text">This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of computer vision and image processing for creative projects and critical discourse.</p> 

    <p class="text">Computer Vision is an area of research centered on how algorithms can extract information from images. This was originally done using still images, later video and now includes 3D data from cameras with 3D sensors. </p>

   <iframe  width="640" height="360" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p class="text">Computer vision has found application in many areas: the military, video games,  police surveillance, robotics, etc. For artists and designers, computer vision can bring interactivity to works allowing reaction to body movement and motion, and allowing for the creation of new forms of imagery.</p> 

        <p class="text">Through the exploration of these technologies for creative purposes we’ll have the opportunity to see how these algorithms may be used for privacy and surveillance and what problems it might pose to use them within different contexts. In a time when access to cameras and sharing of imagery is commonplace, the possibility of analyzing or manipulating images allows for new forms of commentary and creativity.</p>

    <p class="text">This course will be taught using Openframeworks.</p>

    <iframe src="" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <h4 class="title">Who is this program for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This workshop is geared toward anyone involved in creative projects (designers, makers, artists, musicians, performers etc.) that want to begin incorporating computer vision into their work or practice. The course approaches computer vision from an introductory level, however a basic knowledge of programming (in any language/platform) is encouraged.</p>

<p>Hands-on experience making interactive audio/visual works using openframeworks</p>
<p>A deeper understanding of the technologies behind surveillance and how you can 
intercept and engage with them in creative and subversive ways</p>
