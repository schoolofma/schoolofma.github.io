      <p class="text">Join the School of Machines in Berlin this June for a four-week pop-up co-working/co-creation opportunity. This is a unique chance to work, play and collaborate with like-minded creatives and artists in the heart of Berlin's creative technology community. You will also have full access to our equipment and facilities.</p>

      <p class="text">The School of Machines is taking over the ACUD Studio and ACUD Gallery from 5th - 30th of June. As one of the few remaining art spaces in the centre of Berlin, ACUD boasts a phenomenal location and a long heritage. We want to extend our creative community, so we are opening it up to you too!</p>

<p class="text">Along with an awesome location to work, you'll also have the option to use the Studio and Gallery for organising your own workshops and events. Have an idea for a short-course? Need help with planning and execution of your event idea? We'll do what we can to bring your idea to life!</p>

<p class="text">The School of Machines has been exploring the intersection of art and technology for over three years and you will have access to all of the equipment and expertise we have accumulated along the way! </p>

<p class="text">Interested in getting into art and technology, wanna play around with computer vision and VR with others? We've got tools and eager participants, join someone else's project or work on your own!</p>

<p class="text">This is aimed at artists, creatives, designers, performers and anyone else interested in working for four-weeks amongst Berlin's creative technology community.</p>
