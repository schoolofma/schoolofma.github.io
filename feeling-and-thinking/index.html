<p class="text">We invite you to apply for our creative research residency set to take place this spring in Belgrade, Serbia. It's a residency in three parts: self-initiated learning, group teaching and sharing, and community outreach. </p>

<p class="text">Through participation in this program, attendees will have a unique opportunity to investigate topics related to creative artificial intelligence and machine learning for artists with a group of like-minded peers and experienced mentors for up to four-weeks, this April 2017.</p>

<p class="text">Individually and as a group, we'll spend time examining the ethical and sociocultural dimensions of machine learning, while discussing issues of significance surrounding the ever-increasing integration of these thinking machines into our daily lives.</p>

<p class="text">This program will coincide with Belgrade's beloved annual Resonate festival dedicated to creative technology, as well as audiovisual and music performance.</p>

<h4 class="title">Overview of Machine Learning
</h4>

    <p class="text">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the design of data-driven programs which autonomously demonstrate intelligent behavior in a variety of domains.</p>

  <p class="text">Machine learning systems are all around us. When you deposit a check, scan your fingerprint, or post a picture on social media, autonomous algorithms are deployed on the spot to sift through and make sense of your constant interactions with our technology.</p>

  <p class="text">Machine learning silently underpins the fabric of our digital infrastructure, discriminating spam e-mail and banking fraud, making light-speed transactions in the global financial market, recommending music and films for customers to buy, deciding what search results are relevant to your queries, and countless more of the daily interactions with electronic media that we take for granted. </p>

<p class="text">Machine learning is the backbone that powers self-driving cars, content recommendation in social media, face identification in digital forensics, and countless other high-level tasks. It has gained rapid interest from the digital arts community, with the recent appearance of numerous artistic hacks of scientific research, such as Deepdream, Stylenet, NeuralTalk, and others.</p>

<p class="text">Creative re-appropriation of these techniques is necessary to refocus machine learning's influence on those things which we care about. Artistic metaphors help clarify that which is otherwise shrouded by layers of academic jargon, making these highly specialized subjects more accessible to everyday people. Taking such an approach, we can repurpose these academic tools and harness their capabilities for creative expression and empowerment.

<h4 class="title">Who is this residency for?
</h4>

<p class="text">This creative research residency is aimed at people working in creative disciplines who wish to learn more about machine intelligence and how to apply it in their own fields. It is *not* aimed at scientists or engineers who are seeking a rigorous technical course on machine learning-- and in fact it is not a *course* at all. </p>

<p class="text">Rather, this as a hands-on, self-directed learning retreat. No specialized knowledge of mathematics or computer science is assumed or expected of participants. Individually, we'll build up our own understanding of the subject from elementary building blocks, imagination, analogy, and metaphor. This residency is more practical than it is theoretical; we are interested less in proving theorems and equations, and more into bringing people together who are keen on researching relevant topics and/or hacking existing tools for making machines that do interesting things. </p>

<p class="text">People of diverse backgrounds and interests will all find something to take away from this creative residency experience. If you are a journalist interested in the socioeconomic ramifications of increased automation, a musician wanting to manipulate your instruments with data streams, a designer wishing to imbue your craft with machine artifacts, or you’re just plain old fascinated by the age-old philosophical dilemma of cognition, this residency program is for you.
</p>

Her work generally falls along the lines of music generation, data visualization/sonification/representation/analysis, natural language processing, machine learning, and storytelling in various formats. She's interested in pretty much everything, but her current passions include music, possible futures, weird/”subjective” datasets, ideas along the lines of consciousness/language/empathy/identity, and microbiomes.</p>

            <p class="text">Hannah is currently working on TransProse, a literature-to-music translation program, and more recently have been starting to create interesting datasets for art and machine learning.</p>
