        <h4 class="title">Course Description</h4>


        <p class="text">In this program, we will set out to design two immersive experiences, an escape room, and a waiting room designed for that escape room.</p>
          

          <p class="text">To be alive is to be waiting for something. But what are we waiting for and why are we waiting for it? With the onslaught of new technologies, we find ourselves waiting even more, often for experiences (AR, VR, etc.), the likes of which are often less than ten minute encounters. With these questions in mind, this program is about waiting and waiting room design from a practical and future perspective as no doubt waiting room design will increasingly become a career of the future. How can we begin to create meaningful designed experiences for waiting rooms that enhance the experience we are waiting for?</p>

          <p class="text">This course is fundamentally about designing immersive experiences. What considerations are there when designing for full immersion? When time is of the essence, where do we focus our attention to ensure that the show goes on? What kinds of talents and skills are necessary for such an undertaking?</p>

          <p class="text">Finally, we'll learn the finer points of escape room design and take on the ambitious task of designing one ourselves which will be open to the public as part of the final showcase of the program.</p>

          <p class="text">This is a very special program made up of brilliant guest speakers, each specialised in very niche and fantastical fields. The full-time course facillitator for this program will be Rachel Uwa, founder of School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe, and joining her will be a talented and ever-changing cast of brilliant co-horts joining briefly to enlighten us on the tasks at hand.</p>

          <p class="text">Omer Fast is a video artist based in Berlin. Much of his work delves into the psychology of contemporary trauma, often relying on the blurring of memory and the retelling of actual events through cinematic convention. Fast’s work moves beyond the formalities of the genre, pushing through reality and non-reality of his subject matter, and is ultimately about the status of the image as a tool to disseminate information, both real and manufactured.</p>

<p class="text">Omer Fast (b. 1972, Jerusalem) will present a solo exhibition of new work in 2019 at the Salzburger Kunstverein, Austria. Other recent solo exhibitions have taken place at the Times Museum, Guangzhou, China; STUK Leuven, Belgium; Minneapolis Institute of Art, MN; and Martin Gropius Bau, Berlin, Germany. In October 2015, a monographic exhibition of Fast’s work titled Present Continuous opened at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, and subsequently travelled to the Baltic Center of Contemporary Arts, Gateshead, UK, and the KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art, Aalborg. Denmark. He has also been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands;  Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden; Le Caixa, Madrid, Spain; Musée d’Art Contemporain, Montréal, Canada; Museum of Contemporary Art, Krakow, Poland; STUK Leuven, Belgium; Dallas Museum of Art, TX; Cleveland Museum of Art, OH; the Art Institute of Chicago, IL; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, NY.</p>

<p class="text">Fast's work was featured in dOCUMENTA (13), the 54th Venice Biennale, and the 2002 and 2008 Whitney Biennials. He received a BFA from Tufts University and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and an MFA from Hunter College in New York City. He is represented by James Cohan, New York.</p>

          <p class="text">School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe was founded by Rachel Uwa. Rachel is an artist, educator, and organiser whose background is in audio engineering and vfx compositing.</p>

<p class="text">Over the past 15+ years she’s lived in and organized social justice and tech communities and events big and small. She feels compelled to help bring these two worlds together and make the tech world less daunting and more diverse, inclusive, thoughtful, and fun.</p>

<p class="text">Rachel's biggest desire is to see people living the lives they dream of living rather than the one they feel they ought to. If that dream life is more artistic, creative, socially-engaged, technology-embracing and connects humans to each other and to themselves, well, all the better.</p>
